type should an identifier for the error. It could be very general, such
as "namespace", or have more granularity in order to differentiate the
different types of namespace errors that can occur in a document.
Providing a complete description of type in that case would require
doing a catalog of namespace errors, which is something we want to avoid
(the XML Core WG avoided it as well, at least for now). So, when the
type is not given explicitly, it's up to your implementation to provide
one.

This one also requires clarification in LS...
