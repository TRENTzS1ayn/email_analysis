The DOM2 Events specification appears to be unclear about exactly which
objects the "load" event applies to.

In a pure XML context, is it the root element, or the document itself,
that receives this event?

In an (X)HTML context, does the body element get the event?

If the latter, then how does one attach a load event to a document before
the body node has been loaded into the document? (As is common with load
events, since the document is typically not going to be fully loaded when
the event is attached.)

Some clarifications to the DOM2 Events specification would be very useful.
This ambiguity is preventing Mozilla from implementing 'load' event
listeners at this time. (Bug 99820.)
