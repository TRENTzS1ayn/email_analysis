The DOM Working Group is in Candidate Recommendation phase for the DOM 
XPath API.

The working group needs to identify implementations, partial or 
complete, of this API.

It is also important to know what the language binding of the 
implementation is.  For example:

The Mozilla XPath implementation is written and available in XPCOM.  Of 
additional interest, it is exposed using Mozilla's xpconnect 
architecture, meaning it is accessible from browser ECMAScript and any 
other language such as perhaps Python, that can access through xpconnect 
in Mozilla.

There have been reports of other C / C++ implementations with no details 
whether these may be available through other bindings.

There are also reports of Java and other-language implementations but we 
need any details you can make available if you are implementing this DOM 
module.

This is also the time to give implementation-related feedback as 
outlined in the specification:

http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-XPath/

The DOM WG expects to have a test suite soon to demonstrate 
implementation of various aspects of the specification, which is 
required to advance the specification.
