None of these are my implementations and in no way do I speak for any 
of the development teams. In addition to Mozilla, the DOM L3 XPath 
implementations that I could find:

Xalan-J (http://xml.apache.org) : Contains an experimental 
implementation the 28 March 2002 L3 XPath Working Draft.  Since the 
initial commit of the work last September, there has been no obvious 
activity.  This implementation provides an XPathEvaluator that can work 
with an arbitrary DOM implementation.  The DOM test suite has an 
adapter to support Xalan-J + Xerces-J, but most tests fail due to 
changes in the spec.

Pathan and Pathan-P 
(http://software.decisionsoft.com/pathanIntro.html): Implementation of 
8 Feb 2002 WD on that acts on a Xerces-C DOM implementation.

gdome2 (http://gdome2.cs.unibo.it): C implementation of 8 Feb 2003 WD

Saxon 7 (http://saxon.sf.net) contains an XPathEvaluator class that is 
documented as being "loosely based on the proposed 
org.w3c.dom.xpath.XPathEvaluator interface, though it does not actually 
implement this interface at present."
