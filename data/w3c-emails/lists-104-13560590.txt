We decided to not add the requested functionality.   There are
different ways to determine what schema is associated with the
document, e.g., DOM L3 CORE schemaTypeInfo, but since there
is no standard mechanism to bind schemas to documents, we will
not be the ones to specify such a standard or to indicate how to attach
such schemas to documents.

If schema location were modified or removed, behavior would be
implementation dependent.

Thanks,
Ben
