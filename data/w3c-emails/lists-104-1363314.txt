I'm trying to understand the detach() method of the Range interface.
Any insight is appreciated!

In languages that support garbage collection, such as Java and
JavaScript, is it safe to allow a Range object to be garbage collected
even if detach() has never been called?

May implementations in languages without automatic memory management
require that the detach() method must be called before a Range object is
freed up?

Does the detach() method exist because the implementation must keep
track of all Range objects in a document so that they may be altered as
necessary by document insertions and deletions?
