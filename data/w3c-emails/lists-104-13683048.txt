Here is the current NameList interface as defined in the incoming
version of the Core draft (to be published really soon):

// Introduced in DOM Level 3:
interface NameList {
  DOMString          getName(in unsigned long index)
                                        raises(DOMException);
  DOMString          getNamespaceURI(in unsigned long index)
                                        raises(DOMException);
  readonly attribute unsigned long   length;
};

It does not define a method to create an Element or Attr node, but doing
so can be achieved easily using the createX() methods.

Our current effort is focused on updating the Core and Load/Save drafts
so those drafts should be back in sync soon.
