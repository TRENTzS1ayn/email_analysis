The current L/S draft appears close but insufficient to invoke SOAP or 
WebDAV methods.  I think it would be very beneficial if it could.  I 
believe two additional parameters to parseURI could be sufficient:

Document parseURI(DOMString uri, DOMString method, Document body)

Where method and body could be null.
