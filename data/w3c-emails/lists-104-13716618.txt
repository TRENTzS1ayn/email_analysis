The namespaceURI parameter on this method is undesirable.  If it was 
removed, the method could return all global scope elements in any 
namespace that is available in the bound schema.  If it was really 
desired to limit the list to a specific namespace, it would trivial to 
filter that list to the names in a specific namespace.   As it is, 
however, to get the list of all available global elements you have to 
have some other mechanism to determine all namespaces that are defined 
or imported in the bound schema.
