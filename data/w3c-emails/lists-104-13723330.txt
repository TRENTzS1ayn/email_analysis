The LS is short at providing an IO library. No HTTP headers,
authentification, etc. You cannot access the HTTP headers of the
received document either. If we add your proposal, why should we stop
half-way? You can always use an external library to manipulate those and
give an input stream to the DOMBuilder.

However, we did include for SOAP 1.2 the following parameter for the
configuration of the DOMBuilder:

"disallow-doctype"

 true
  [optional]
  Throw a fatal error if a doctype node is found while parsing the
  document. This may be useful when dealing with things like SOAP
  envelopes where doctype nodes are not allowed.
 false
  [required] (default)
  Allow doctype nodes in the document.
