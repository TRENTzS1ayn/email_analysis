1.  LAST CALL ANNOUNCEMENT: DOM CORE

This is the last call announcement from the W3C DOM Working
Group (DOM WG) for review of the DOM Level 3 Core
Specification.

http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/

2. REQUEST FOR DOCUMENT REVIEW

The DOM WG asks for review of the following document:

Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Core Specification

This specification defines the Document Object Model Core
Level 3, a platform- and language-neutral interface that
allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update
the content, structure and style of documents.  The Document
Object Model Core Level 3 builds on the Document Object Model
Core Level 2 [DOM Level 2 Core <http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/references.html#DOM2Core>].

The document is available at:

http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-DOM-Level-3-Core-20030609/

See Appendix A for a list of changes between DOM Level 2 Core
and DOM  Level 3 Core specifications.
