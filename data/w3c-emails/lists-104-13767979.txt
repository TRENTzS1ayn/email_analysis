There was always good intentions to add Python test generation to the 
DOM Test  Suite (http://www.w3.org/DOM/Test) effort.  That would 
probably be the easiest way to get a decent amount of test coverage.  If 
you'd like to take a shot at manually coverting some of the generated 
Java or Javascript tests, I'd be willing to create a variant of the 
existing stylesheets to produce Python tests.  If interested, please 
follow up on www-dom-ts@w3.org.
