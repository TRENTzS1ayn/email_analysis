In the descriptions of the Range.setStart() and Range.setEnd() methods
of the DOM Level 2 Range specification, the refNode argument is
documented self-referentially as "The refNode value".

I suspect that the author intended to say "the startContainer value" and
"the endContainer value" for setStart() and setEnd() respectively.
