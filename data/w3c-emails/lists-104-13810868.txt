NodeList.item(0) could very easily be a character element containing
whitespace (possibly a carriage return) in which case a cast could and
should throw an exception. Check if the values of nodeType, and nodeName
match your expectations?

If you are serious about this, you might consider porting the DOM Test
suites to your implementation. Please see http://www.w3.org/DOM/Test for
more details and if you'd like to follow up please email www-dom-ts@w3.org.
