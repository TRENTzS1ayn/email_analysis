W3C DOM CSS describe that it returns the value of the property
if it has been explicitly set for this declaration block.
And returns the empty string if the property has not been set
or the property name does not correspond to a known CSS property.
at http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSSStyleDeclaration

I don't understand what this means exactly by 'known property'.

Does it mean that ::removeProperty() don't return the value
on removing property of unknown name, even if the property
have value explicitly?

Or, something undefined happen on removing unknown property?

Thanks in advance,
Kang Jeong-Hee.
