We added the following in the description of the MouseEvent interface:
[[
Note: When initializing MouseEvent objects using initMouseEvent or
initMouseEventNS, implementations should use the client coordinates
clientX and clientY for calculation of other coordinates (such as target
coordinates exposed by DOM Level 0 implementations).
]]

screen and client coordinates were part of DOM Level 2 MouseEvent
interface and therefore cannot be removed without breaking the backward
compatibility. Adding target coordinates on top of them would add more
confusion than anything else. So the decision was to keep the status quo
and add the note above.

As usual, let us know if you are satisfy or not with the resolution.
