I think you may correct although I was taught to use apostrophe in this 
case.  I have seen style guides that say either way, and can easily 
search and find many guides saying either way on the internet, not that 
I can tell the weight a particular English professor writing a style 
guide carries (such as 
http://info.citruscollege.com/FF/tEiland/grammar/plurals.htm).

We should make sure we are consistent at any rate, since the Core 
specification seems to always do it without apostrophe and the Load and 
Save specification always seems to do it with apostrophe.

We are clearly dealing with camel casing when naming multiple-word 
things, which is used throughout the specification, for example: 
Document.documentURI.

I know we are not always consistent, but I believe in this case our 
usage is correct and consistent with many other usages throughout the 
specification.
