FYI, the issues list of Validation has been updated. If you sent an
issue in the past and don't know what happen it, check the list. If you
don't find it, or don't think you're satisfied with the final
resolution, then let us know asap. Ben sent responses to the latest
issues yesterday. One follow-up from Curt (curt3) still needs to be
closed though.
