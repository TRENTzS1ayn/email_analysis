Hi:
  As part of DOM Level 3 Load and Save specification ( June 19 2003 : 
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-DOM-Level-3-LS-20030619 ) java binding "DOMWriter" 
is moved to 
  
  "org.w3c.dom.DOMWriter" ( similarly DOMOutputStream ) . The idea may be to put 
this as part of "DOM Level 3 Core specification".
  
  But the latest available version of "DOM L3 Core spec [ June 9,2003 ]" ( 
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-DOM-Level-3-Core-20030609  ) doesn't specify this 
interface.
  
  Can't the different DOM L3 specs can be in sync?? Is somebody trying to 
resolve this issue??
  
  Regards
  -Ramesh
