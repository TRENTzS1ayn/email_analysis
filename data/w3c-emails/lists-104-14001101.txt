this is an error, it should be java.io.DOMWriter
ditto for org.w3c.dom.DOMReader, org.w3c.dom.DOMInputStream, and
org.w3c.dom.DOMOutputStream.

That's correct.

hum, looking at xml-source.xml, I do see
--map-type Java DOMInputStream java.io.InputStream
--map-type Java DOMOutputStream java.io.OutputStream
--map-type Java DOMReader java.io.Reader
--map-type Java DOMWriter java.io.Writer

I overlooked the result of the Java compiler when I generated the
specification and didn't see the compiler errors :(

I'm going to track the error and see what's wrong our the DOM script
generator.

Thanks for the report!
