I published a corrected version of the DOM script generator [1], and
uploaded a compiled version at:
http://www.w3.org/2003/06/27-specgenerator.jar

use it as follows:
java -jar 27-specgenerator.jar \
--map-type Java void void  --bindings \
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-DOM-Level-3-LS-20030619/xml-source.xml

You'll need SAX and DOM bindings in your classpath as well.

This will generate appropriate bindings, according to their definitions
in the LS chapter. Apologies for the inconvenience.

I also noted that the IDL in the LS specification contains errors (some
parameter names conflict with their types). "context" is also used as a
parameter name but is reserved by the OMG specification to be used as
context objects for operations. So expect some parameter renaming in the
next version of LS (not an issue for Java, but it is an issue for some
bindings such as Python). This includes the methods parseWithContext,
startElement, acceptNode, write, writeURI, writeToString, and saveXML.

We tried to make sure that LS and Core are in sync (which is why you
have the issue DOMSerializer-iucd-issue in the LS specification), so any
inconsistency found between those specifications is an error and needs
to be reported as such in this mailing list.
