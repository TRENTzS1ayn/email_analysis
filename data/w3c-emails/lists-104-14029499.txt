I am not arguing that we should settle on URI's, but you 
mischaracterized the one example I cited that clearly did not restrict 
it as you claim, but only said "Rarely" and I quote from its examples:

    * Instead of &'s in your sentences, use and's and other additive
      conjunctions.
    * Most of my friends have M.S.'s and PhD's.
    * Mind your P's and Q's.
    * She used to sell BMW's; now she sells IRA'S at BofA's throughout
      the state.

The explanation was that without the apostrophe, it is confusing whether 
the s is part of the abbreviation or not.  The argument could be made 
that because these acronyms are typically all-caps, adding the s to the 
end is not too ambiguous (assuming that the upper-case S used to make 
IRA plural is an error) but that is not a case made by the cited page or 
its examples.  I find the example of BMW's hardly different from that of 
URI's.

Sorry, I rushed that one and thought you were talking about writeURI and 
not the URI parameter.  It is not about camel casing, and should be made 
consistent with other parameters.  You are correct.
