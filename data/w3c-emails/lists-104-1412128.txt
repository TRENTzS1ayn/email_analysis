In section 8.10 of the Range spec the argument to the
surroundContents() method is first defined as "n", and then later
referred to as "node".

Similarly, in the API specification, the argument is first defined as
"newParent", but then in the descriptions of the exceptions it may
throw, it is called "node" (see INVALID_NODE_TYPE_ERR and
HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR).
