In case you didn't see the W3C homepage, DOM Level 2 HTML was approved
as a W3C Recommendation on January 9:
 http://www.w3.org/2003/01/doml2html-pressrelease

Changes since the Proposed Recommendation:
The status of the document has been updated to better emphasize that DOM
Level 2 HTML was not going to apply to XHTML versions beyond 1.0 (1.1
and higher). Also, the following clarifications have been made:
- the specification does not intend to define exactly how a user agent
will respond to a change to any attribute on an element that directly or
indirectly references external data;
- during the handling of a click event on an input element with a type
attribute that has the value "radio" or "checkbox", some implementations
may change the value of this property before the event is being
dispatched in the document.

We have no knowledge of any licensing processes, nor claims of
infringement, so we do not believe that patented technology was required
for implementation.

The DOM WG was meeting on that day which explains this late notice.
