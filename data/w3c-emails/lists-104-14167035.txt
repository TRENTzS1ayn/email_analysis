xml-source.xml from the DOM Level 2 HTML recommendation and from the DOM 
L3 Validation working draft reference the previously mentioned URL which 
does not respond at the current time.  Most other references to the DTD 
are relative and resolve to the DTD provided in the .zip file.

Also, the L2 HTML xml-source.xml file declares a 'us-ascii' encoding but 
uses ISO latin characters such as /xA9.

I'll compensate for these in the DOM Test suite build file, but it would 
be good to get the DTD available again.
