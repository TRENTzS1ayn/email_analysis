Looks ok from my side. Network or server problem?

This one is problematic. Both the XSL generator and XML validator failed
to comply with the us-ascii encoding. I cannot change the DOM Level 2
HTML REC file unfortunately. Would a copy of the xml-source.xml with the
appropriate encoding be helpful somewhere else on the W3C site?
