I've been using Saxon 6.5.2.  Ant will automatically use it if placed in 
the ant/lib directory and there is not a xalan.jar there.

Obviously, it would be nice if we could reliably build with Xalan-J 
since it comes bundled with Ant.  However, it has been pretty difficult 
to reproduce some of the problems in isolation.  I hadn't run into the 
NullPointerException issue, I'll try to isolate the problem, file a bug 
report and tweak the transform.

Use the ANT_OPTS environment variable to pass Java VM options

SET ANT_OPTS=-Xmx512m
