Yup. This works. All 490 tests build ok now. Quite a bit faster too. Interestingly it
had no effect on the NullPointerException I mentioned. If I take out that fix I still get
it:

[miallen@miallen3 DOM-Test-Suite]$ ant dom1-dtd
Buildfile: build.xml
...

dom1-dtd:
    [style] Processing /home/miallen/p/c/domts/2001/DOM-Test-Suite/build/dom1-interfaces.xml to /home/miallen/p/c/domts/2001/DOM-Test-Suite/build/dom1.dtd
