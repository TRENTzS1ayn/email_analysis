I've noticed an issue regarding DOM Events, Levels 2 and 3, which is not 
clear in the specifications.

For event capturing and bubbling, if the actual target (or an ancestor node 
of the actual target) is removed or replaced, the specs do not state the 
correct behavior of the Event object.  I'd like a clarification on whether 
the Event object should continue to propagate, should bubble later, should 
throw a strict warning or DOM exception, etc.

I have a bug filed at mozilla.org's Bugzilla 
(http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=191242 ) to resolve the issue 
in Mozilla.  The bug has two testcases you can reach via link -- one in XUL 
(you will need a Gecko-based browser such as Mozilla or K-Meleon to see it), 
and one in XHTML.  Both testcases use ECMAScript to access the DOM.

Very respectfully,
