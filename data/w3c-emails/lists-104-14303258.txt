It is defined in the Events specification, even if it is in the capture
phase description but still applies for the entire event propagation:
[[
The chain of EventTargets from the top of the tree to the event's target
is determined before the initial dispatch of the event. If modifications
occur to the tree during event processing, event flow will proceed based
on the initial state of the tree.
]]
