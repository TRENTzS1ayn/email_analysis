If a "bubbling" event listener is registered during the capture phase of
the event propagation, it will be triggered. If a "capturing" event
listener is registered during the capture phase of the event
propagation, it will not be triggered.

[[
If an EventListener is added to an EventTarget while it is processing an
event, it will not be triggered by the current actions but may be
triggered during a later stage of event flow, such as the bubbling
phase.
