There does not seem to be any provision for the caller to specify a 
specific grammar for validation.  Validation depends on the document 
containing a document type declaration, a xsi:schemaLocation or equivalent.

A grammar attribute of type Node on DocumentEditVAL could be used to 
specify the external grammar (also potentially determine default 
grammars located by xsi:schemaLocation attributes, though that might be 
add more complication than it is valuable).  DTD's could be associated 
by loading a template document and setting DocumentEditVAL.grammer to 
the DocumentType node of the template document.  Schemas could be 
associated by setting grammer to an Element or Document node containing 
a single schema.  Schema collections could be represented by a 
DocumentFragment containing multiple xs:schema elements.

validateDocument() would also need a grammar parameter.

The working draft does not discuss the behavior if a schema location 
hint is modified or removed.  Would removing a xsi:schemaLocation 
attribute on the document element allow you to change the document at will?
