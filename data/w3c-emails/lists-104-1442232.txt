CSSStyleDeclaration.setProperty() takes a priority argument which is
described as "the new priority of the property".  The problem is that it
does not specify what value should be passed for properties that have no
priority specification.

I'm guessing that an empty string is the intended value to indicate no
priority.  However, I'm not sure what the method should do if null is
passed.  If this is an illegal value, I guess it should throw a
SYNTAX_ERR exception.

Can someone clarify this, please?
