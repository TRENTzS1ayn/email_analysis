The 2 questions that you are asking are related to the Candidate
Recommendation phase of the draft, not the current one. If the answers
were yes, we would move directly to Proposed Recommendation. Briefly, 
1) it's in progress
2) there are plans.

As soon as we have tests, they'll be submitted to the TS repository.

As for DOM Level 2 HTML, we will do an implementation report.
