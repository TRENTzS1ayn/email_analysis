Sanity check: What would coding a node filter into the event system do for 
you that coding your event listeners to accept and test a filter wouldn't? 
And is that difference important to you?

(I can see why filtering would be a useful metaphor here, but I don't yet 
see a usecase for asking DOM implementations to deal with it rather than 
having the application do so.)
