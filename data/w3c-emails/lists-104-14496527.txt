Hi all,

I once implemented the DOM Level 3 XPath Module WD which contained 
things like XPathSetSnapshot, XPathSetIterator, createExpression, 
SINGLE_NODE_TYPE, NODE_SET_TYPE, etc etc... everything that does
 not exist anylonger. Why? Huh? What's the ChangeLog? Can't there just 
be a changelog for enforce the developer to re-read the whole draft? This
 of course applies to all drafts out there.

ChangeLogs would make live so much easier(!).

The types SINGLE_NODE_TYPE and NODE_SET_TYPE are gone 
and the following has been added:
* UNORDERED_NODE_ITERATOR_TYPE,
* ORDERED_NODE_ITERATOR_TYPE,
* UNORDERED_NODE_SNAPSHOT_TYPE,
* ORDERED_NODE_SNAPSHOT_TYPE,
* ANY_UNORDERED_NODE_TYPE, and
* FIRST_ORDERED_NODE_TYPE.

But when should a XPathResult be what of them?
What about comparisons between all these new node types?
What of the above node types is to be used for a single node result?
What of the above node types is to be used for a simple node list? 
e.g. for "/*", "//elem[@attr=$b]"? Both result a node set,but of what 
result-type?

Also, the evaluate function does not take any parameter for 
function/variable-scope. Why? This would be a nice way to extend the 
function's provided as well as allow you easily to manipulate the variables 
needed by the xpath expression of interest.

Also, why does DOM Level 3 Modules rely on DOM Level 2 Core and not Level 3 
Core? Core 2.0 is in recommendation state, yes, but I think that XPath 3.0 
should rely on Core 3.0 or it should be said somewhere in the XPath 3.0 
Module draft that this also applies to Core 3.0 (WD) shouldn't it?

Thanks in advance,
Christian Parpart.

(p.s.: Please do also CC me to trapni@gmx.de since the surakware.net (+email) 
server will go down within next days for some time to move - many thanks)
