Sorry I did not respond to this earlier.

The example is a bit confusing to me as you have given it, mostly 
because I am not familiar with this sort of function of XForms.

I think it is quite safe to say that DOM XPath never creates significant 
new content as part of it's execution, as the example appears to do.
It returns existing nodes, and that is all.

I assume you are saying that XForms would construct the new instance, 
but merely needs to be able to execute the position function within the 
context of each node in the former node set, reentering the active XPath 
context.

You have suggested one of several ways to do this.  XSLT, like XForms, 
would need this sort of extension to accomplish it's work.  If someone 
were defining a custom XPath function that needed to reinvoke XPath in 
it's full context, this sort of thing would be needed in that case, too.

It is clear that an an XSLT processor would also need additional 
interfaces for providing custom variable and function extensions 
required by XSLT.  This sort of thing was considered out of scope for 
this version of the interface (see 
http://www.w3.org/2002/03/DOM-Level-3-XPath-issues/all.html#a6).
