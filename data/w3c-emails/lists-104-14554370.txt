Possibly you know this already since the draft is a little old,
but in section 1.3 of the Load-Save draft,

"The expectation is that an instance of the DOMImplementationLS 
interface can be obtained by using binding-specific casting methods on 
an instance of the DOMImplementation interface or, if the Document 
supports the feature "Core" version "3.0" defined in [DOM Level 3 Core], 
by using the method Node.getInterface with parameter values "LS-Load" 
and "3.0" (respectively)."

should read

can be obtained by using binding-specific casting methods on an instance 
of the DOMImplementation interface or, if the Document supports the 
feature "Core" version "3.0" defined in [DOM Level 3 Core], by using the 
method DOMIMplementation.getInterface with parameter values "LS-Load" 
and "3.0" (respectively)."


That is, change Node.getInterface to DOMIMplementation.getInterface
