Hi,

yet another issue on my list I can't solve belong the the DOM Level 3 
Events Module.

What phase is entered first? I guess 1.) AT_TARGET, 2.) BUBBLING_PHASE, 
and 3.) CAPTURING_PHASE. But I didn't find any pharagraph that mentioned 
this. Also, this is the easiest way to propagate the event through the 
event-targets.

Can a EventListenerGroup contain EventListeners for different EventTargets?
This is an important issue since this would heavily change the implementation 
part.

the EventListenerGroup.isSameEventListenerGroup(grp) function returns true if 
this is really the same event listener group. but would this be even possible 
to test by comparing their pointers like in C++ as follows?

EventListenerGroup *evg1 = myDocument->createEventListenerGroup();
EventListenerGroup *evg2 = myDocument->createEventListenerGroup();
/* ... */
if (evg1 == evg2) ; /* pointer comparison: are they the very same thing? */
if (evg1->isSameEventListenerGroup(evg2)) ; /* your method: like above? */
/* the end */

Best regards,
Christian Parpart.
