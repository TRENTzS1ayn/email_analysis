I already took a look onto that page since this has really been my interest 
for some time. I unfortunately have definitely _not_ that much money they 
want from me. For the non-profit organization case (as this would apply to) 
is twice as much as I get a year(!). With respect to the next bridge I would 
have to live under when I really need to pay that is not my choice.... 
unfortunately.

Of course, I just have a problem in imagination, I believe. When is what type 
used. I mean, I previousely felt good with one node set type to handle any 
node set. So, I'd probably got helped by giving me some use-cases for these 
different node set types. (e.g. the XSLT document() function would return 
just a single document node - FIRST_ORDERED_NODE_TYPE probably - and a 
some/where expression would result in a ordered node set, I think. But what 
about the other node set types? I didn't find a direct hint in the draft.

I was confused, sorry, I meant result types for the different node sets ;)

Well, it's IMHO more difficult to hide the function/variable scopes except you 
do not want to provide the user with handling with user functions/variables.
