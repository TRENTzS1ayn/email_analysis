The Core and Load/Save drafts have been updated:
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-DOM-Level-3-Core-20030226/
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-DOM-Level-3-LS-20030226/

The drafts are ready for Last Call yet unfortunately, especially the
parts related to DOMConfiguration and Document.normalizeDocument.

Core:
- new type addition of the Validation draft: DOmStringList, NameList
- new type DOMImplementationList and new method
Document.getDOMImplementations
- DOMImplementation.getFeature (previously known as getInterface): by
the way, it should return a DOMObject and not a Node... 
- Node.getFeature (previously know as getInterface): It also should
return a DOMObject and not a Node...
- Text.isWhiteSpaceinElementContent() is now a method.
- We added NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR on getNamedItemNS, setNamedItemNS,
removeNamedItemNS (NamedNodeMap interface) and getAttributeNS,
getAttributeNodeNS, getElementsByTagNameNS, hasAttributeNS,
removeAttributeNS, 
- schemaType is now known as schemaTypeInfo
- Attr.isId() is now a method.
- we relaxed the constraints on Attr.value (see the note in the
description of the attribute)
- Element.setIdAttribute nad Element.setIdAttributeNode have extra
parameters: isId.
- Changed the mapping between the PSVI and our TypeInfo interface.
- TypeInfo.name is now TypeInfo.typeName
- TypeInfo.namespace is now TypeInfo.namespaceURI
- Added a node on NODE_DELETED.
- changed the definition of "datatype-normalization" (DOMConfiguration)
- clarified entities resolution and baseURI in DOMConfiguration
- Parameters for DOMConfiguration are now objects, and not boolean (but
this change still generate lots of debates...)

Load/Save:
Unfortunately, the diff tools isn't good enough to compare the new draft
and the old one. There is a lot more than what is listed here.
- ElementLS with ElementLS.markupContent has been added.
- it now takes into account the DOMConfiguration interface from the
Core.
- DOMBuilder.async, DOMBuilder.busy
