I believe that the description indicates why it is not always an
HTMLBodyElement object:
[[
The element that contains the content for the document. In documents
with BODY contents, returns the BODY element. In frameset documents,
this returns the outermost FRAMESET element.
]]
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/REC-DOM-Level-2-HTML-20030109/html.html#ID-56360201

The body attribute may also contain an HTMLFrameSetElement object.
