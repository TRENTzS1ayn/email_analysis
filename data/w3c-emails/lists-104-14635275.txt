Would "within the scope of a prefix-to-namespace binding" help?

This is correct. Remember, the DOM does not require that all namespace 
declaration attributes be present. Thus, there may be implied bindings, 
which may conflict with explicit ones. The namespace fixup algorithm is 
about finding and "realizing" those; the namespace lookup algorithm 
behaves "as if" fixup had been performed.

Yes, if a different prefix happens to be available which is bound to the 
same URI, changing the prefix would suffice. I know this was considered 
during the design of the namespace fixup/lookup algorithms, and various 
trade-offs were discussed; I'd have to re-read the pseudocode to refresh 
myself on what the current status is and why.
