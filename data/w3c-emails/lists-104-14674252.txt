The time is not right for another version.  

The current working group charter expires this summer, and it last
major deliverable is a 2nd Edition of MathML 2.0 that incorporates the
errata/bug fixes collected over the last couple years.  After that,
there will likely be a Math interest group at W3C serving primarily
maintanence and liason roles, and to recharter a working group for a
revision to the spec at some point in the future.

Apart from these administrative reasons, there is a deeper, underlying
reason: many organizations are just now starting to switch over to XML
workflows utilizing MathML.  Until there is some real data about what
problems these adopters really hit, it is too soon the guess what a
revision of the spec should contain.  Further, introducing a new
version of the spec would make existing MathML implementations
obsolete, just as they are actually being deployed and used.  Not a
good idea.
