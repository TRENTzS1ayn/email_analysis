DOM2 HTML says, for the .href property of HTMLAnchorElement:

    The absolute URI [IETF RFC 2396] of the linked resource. See the href
    attribute definition in HTML 4.01.

In contrast to this, for the .longDesc property of HTMLImageElement it says:

    URI [IETF RFC 2396] designating a long description of this image or
    frame.  See the longdesc attribute definition in HTML 4.01.

So if a relative URI is given in <a href="uri"> then the URI is resolved 
relative to the base before being returned via .href.  But what should 
happen with .longDesc?  Should the relative URI string be returned?  Is 
the difference in wording purposeful or accidental?
