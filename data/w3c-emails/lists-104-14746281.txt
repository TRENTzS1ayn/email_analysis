In the Linux environment we use Gdome2 (http://gdome2.cs.unibo.it) which
provides a C DOM API. On top of Gdome2, several bindings for other
programming languages have been provided (C++, Ocaml, Perl, Ruby, and
possibly others I'm not aware of). The interesting thing is that all the
bindings can be generated automatically.

For the C++ and Ocaml bindings, we create the code automatically with
XSLT stylesheets starting from the XML version of the DOM spec (see
http://gmetadom.sourceforge.net). Only a very limited number of classes
must be hand-coded.

I assume it is possible to do something similar for Fortran as well,
although the details on how to do it will likely vary from compiler to
compiler.

Yours,
