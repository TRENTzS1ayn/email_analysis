Looking at the Xalan API I noticed that it may not be impossible to use
proprietary functions in XPath expressions (through namespaces) : if it's
really possible, what does the specification say about how to do it ? On the
other hand, if it's not a standardized issue, would not be such adjunctions
very usefull ?
