I was just looking at the "width" and "height" attributes of HTMLImageElement
and HTMLObjectElement.  These are desribed somewhat differently... The Image
version says (for height): "Height of the image in pixels. See the height
attribute definition in HTML 4.01."  The Object version says: "Override
height. See the height attribute definition in HTML 4.01."

Are these expected to act in similar ways?  HTMLImageElement.height will be the
"intrinsic" image height in current browsers if the "height" attribute is not
set in the HTML.  This behavior is needed because legacy content relies on
it... but is that just a browser quirk or part of the DOM2 HTML specification?
