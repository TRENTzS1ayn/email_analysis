1.  LAST CALL ANNOUNCEMENT: DOM EVENTS

Due to the large number of comments and suggestions on
the DOM Level 3 Events Specification, there have been a
significant number of changes to the specification.  The W3C
DOM Working Group has decided to issue a 2nd Last Call 
for comments:

http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20030331/

2. REQUEST FOR DOCUMENT REVIEW

The DOM WG asks for review of the following document:

Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Events Specification

Abstract: "This specification defines the Document Object 
Model Events Level 3, a generic platform- and language-neutral 
event system which allows registration of event handlers, 
describes event flow through a tree structure, and provides 
basic contextual information for each event. The Document 
Object Model Events Level 3 builds on the Document Object 
Model Events Level 2 [DOM Level 2 Events].

The document is available at:

http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20030331/

See Appendix A for a list of changes between DOM Level 2 Events and DOM 
Level 3 Events specifications.

The changes since the first last call impact throughout the
specification, and it is therefore not practical to recommend 
specific parts that have changed more than others.

3. HOW TO SEND COMMENTS

Comments from any W3C Working Group or Member of the Community are 
welcome on:

4.  INTENTIONS OF DOM WG

Unless the review uncovers substantial problems, the next step will be 
to recommend the document for publication as Candidate Recommendation to 
gain implementation experience.

5. IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE

The DOM WG is looking for implementations of the draft.  If you, or your 
company, are planning to implement (or already has an implementation of) 
this DOM module and are willing to participate in the Candidate 
Recommendation phase with your implementation, please let us know by 
sending a message to the public mailing list www-dom@w3.org.

6. END OF REVIEW PERIOD
