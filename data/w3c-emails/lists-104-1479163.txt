Agreed. newParent is clearly what was intended. I'd say we should accept
that one as an editorial erratum.

(If we hadn't marked "node" as being a keyword, I'd be tempted to claim
this was just a sloppy phrasing of "the argument node" and let it go as
suboptimal-but-harmless. But if we did that we should fix the markup... and
if we're going to edit it at all, we should fix it properly.)
