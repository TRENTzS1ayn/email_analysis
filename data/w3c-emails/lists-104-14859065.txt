http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/glossary.html#dt-interface
define the term 'interface' as a set of methods.

But IDLs of DOM declare properties as well as methods.
How to implement such properties on interfaces?

What is standard de facto for implementation of that?
As Java does, ::getXXX() and ::setXXX() is the answer?
Or nothing special but up to each implementators?

Best regard,
kz.
