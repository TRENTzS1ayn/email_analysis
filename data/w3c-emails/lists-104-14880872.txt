It is generally up to the binding creator, not the implementor, to
follow the rules of the binding when doing this sort of thing.

In the case of Java, this means using a getter and setter.

In the case of ECMAScript, this typically is exposed as a real attribute.

When creating other bindings, the creator should use whatever is natural
for the binding.
