Hi all,

For the following XML:

  <?xml version='1.0'?><foo f='100'></foo>

when getChildNodes() is called on the root element, different 
implementations of DOM return NodeList of different length.

Xerces2-J and Crimson return a NodeList which contains 1 Text node of value 
"100"
DOM4j and Python's minidom return a NodeList containing no nodes.

This could be a problem if one's doing a comparison between two DOM 
implementations.  Unfortunately, this case is not covered by the current 
DOM-TS, and I couldn't find anything on DOM spec.  What should be the 
correct haviour?

Thanks in advance,

ML
