I tried to get information about the global object for JavaScript. There is no information about it in neither JavaScript Core/Reference nor HTML Specification, so I went through the ECMAScript specification once again and found out that in a chapter about global object it states that 'the HTML document object model states that the window property of the global object is the global object itself'. However, the DOM doesn't state anything like that. And reading the discussion on this topic in the DOM mailing list a question came up. How can I refer to the global object in the HTML? What is its name? Is it window or document or maybe even something else? Does document.open means the same as window.open? Because I am afraid that when using, for instance, window.open it is possible that a browser (not IE and not Netscape) won't support it and the whole script wouldn't run as it was intended!!!
