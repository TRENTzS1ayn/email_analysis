Some initial comments, more will follow.

Section 1.2.4:

The text describing DOMObject is a copy of the DOMUserData description.

Section 1.3.1:

"typically using uppercase for element names and lowercase for attribute 
names"

See http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom/2003AprJun/0104.html.  
The "typical" behavior in the L3 Core is contrary to DOM L2 HTML which 
specifies that both attribute names and element names should be 
uppercase which currently only Opera and Konqueror implement.  The best 
solution I see is to issue an errata to L2 HTML specifying that 
attribute should be lowercase.  Otherwise, this sentence should be 
expanded to not appear to be recommending behavior contrary to L2 HTML.

Section 1.3.3:

"For example, applications may have to declare every namespace in use 
when serializing a document"

This may be a holdover before L3 Load/Save with L/S, I do not believe 
that you would have to add xmlns attributes for namespaces in use.

"Note: Element.setAttributesNS(null...) put"

Should be "puts"

"The new methods, such as Document.createElementNS"

These methods were introduced in L2 Core and in this context would not 
be "new"

Section 1.3.5:

"are developing DOM extensions"

Is the tense correct.  I think that they "have developed" might be more 
appropriate now.

Section 1.3.6:

"thus for versions "1.0", "2.0", "3.0"

There has been a bug on www-dom-ts to ask for clarification if 
hasFeature("Core", "1.0") should return true since the L1 recommendation 
only had "XML" and "HTML" features.  This sentence should reflect the 
resolution of that issue.  At the end of the first paragraph of 1.4, 
"1.0" is omitted which could be interpreted as supporting the "Core 
didn't exist in L1" position.
