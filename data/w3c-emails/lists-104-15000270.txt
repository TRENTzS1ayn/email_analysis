From the Core draft:

"However, when the feature "LS" defined in [DOM Level 3 Load and Save]
is supported by the DOM implementation, the parameter
"resource-resolver" can also be used on DOMConfiguration objects
attached to Document nodes." 

From the LS draft:

"DOMResourceResolver provides a way for applications to redirect
references to external resources. Applications needing to implement
custom handling for external resources can implement this interface
and register their implementation by setting the resourceResolver
attribute of the DOMParser."

So the two drafts are saying different things.
What is worse, the LS draft is self-inconsistent, as the DOMParser
interface has no resourceResolver attribute.
