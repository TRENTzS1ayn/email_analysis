The 5 Feb 2003 validation draft has a ElementEditVAL.contentType METHOD 
returning an unsigned short.  Changing this to an attribute was accepted 
as a last call issue.  I could not find contentType in the 9 June 2003 
Core draft.  If there are multiple methods with the same signature 
(including parameter names) or multiple attributes with the same value 
type the transforms are adequate to handle it.   However, if there is 
both a contentType method and contentType method or the signatures 
differ then the transforms need to be modified.

If there a contentType attribute is added to a core interface returning 
a MIME type, then I would suggest changing the name of 
ElementEditVAL.contentType method to ElementEditVAL.contentModel 
attribute or similar.  The test suite could compensate, but I'd 
recommend not using the same name if the types are different,
