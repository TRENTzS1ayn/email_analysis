Fixed.

(added on the Core issues list)

This is correct, but if an application wishes to serialize a document by
itself, the comment is still valid. So I would be in favor of leaving it
as is.

Fixed.

Correct.

The feature "Core" wasn't defined in "1.0". The text in DOM Level 2 Core
is indeed misleading and should not make any claims regarding
hasFeature("Core", "1.0"). The DOM Level 3 Core was changed as follows:
[[
For example, this specification defines the features "Core" and "XML",
and thus for the version "3.0". Versions "1.0" and "2.0" can also be
used for features defined in the corresponding DOM Levels.
]]

An erratum should be published soon for DOM Level 2.
