Just a minor further nitpick on L3 Core: the DOMError ErrorSeverity
definition group starts at 0; for consistency with the rest of the spec
it should probably be 1.

I complained originally that what exactly DOMError severity meant was
not adequately defined in the WD. Having now implemented it this way, I'd
suggest something like the following:

  A SEVERITY_WARNING error will not cause processing to stop unless
  a DOMErrorHandler returns false. If there is no DOMErrorHandler set
  up, processing will always continue.

  A SEVERITY_ERROR error will cause processing to stop unless a
  a DOMErrorHandler returns true. If there is no DOMErrorHandler set
  up, processing will always stop.

  A SEVERITY_FATAL_ERROR will always cause processing to stop. Return
  value from handleError is ignored.
