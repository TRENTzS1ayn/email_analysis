This was discussed just a little while ago in a thread primarily on the
xerces-j-dev list but with a few messages cc'd here.  Particularly,
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom/2001JulSep/0225.html addresses
this issue.

The current implementation of Xerces-J can dispatch events to a listener
that has been removed.  This shows up in one of my personal DOM Events tests
that are part of domunit (part of the http://xmlconf.sourceforge.net
project) that I anticipate donating to the W3C/NIST DOM testing effort when
we get to Level 2.

Xerces-C does not have an Events implementation currently and I don't know
of any plans to add one.

I'm not either a W3C or DOM WG member or a Xerces committer, so nothing here
is definitive, but I believe that it is reasonably correct.
