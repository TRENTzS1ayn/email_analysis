hi

it is said in the spec that TextEvent and KeyboardEvent are child classes of 
UIEvent (of course). 
UIEvent needs a detail arg to be passed to be initialized. but the initializer 
routines of KeyboardEvent and TextEvent do not get these? Why?
How shall these handle this?

Many thanks,
Christian.
