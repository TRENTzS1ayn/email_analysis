I think what actually needs to be done is some containing standard needs to be developed to standardize the window object - perhaps the "Viewport Object Model." It's proper that the window object is not entirely addressed by the DOM (though it is erroneously, in my opinion, addressed by the DOMHTMLHTMLElement in places). The DOM is for documents, and the document does begin at the HTML element.

But the window object exists in all cases - there is always some User Agent presenting the document - and W3C text often refers to "The Viewport" and its "Canvases." A Spec ought to be written to nail down exactly what these are.

As it stands now many methods and properties belong in the window object, but without a Viewport OM the W3C is unable to specify them. Further, in the case of framesets (which are defined by the W3C), each Frame really ought to be an object that inherits from Viewport (resolving a lot of inconsistencies) rather than the long list of exceptions required today.
