1) Agreed, though this text in the definition obscures what exactly a View is:

====
A document may have one or more "views" associated with it, e.g., a computed view on a document after applying a CSS stylesheet
====

Try to mend this with:

====
There is at most one viewport per canvas, but user agents may render to more than one canvas (i.e., provide different views of the same document).
====
- http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/visuren.html

What then is a "View?" Does this mean there is in fact a Document, a connected set of Canvases, and for each Canvas an AbstractView and DocumentView? If so - where is the definition of Canvas?


2) This is stating the obvious but AbstractView has no definition besides its relationship to DocumentView (meaning basically, it is a sibling to Document). If AbstractView in fact represents the window object, shouldn't there be a "View" (presumably the implementation of "Abstract"View) and some properties underneath it, such as height and width?
