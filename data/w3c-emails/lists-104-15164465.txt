A canvas is a screen area which had been prepared to receive painting.
An HTML document, and its associated DOM tree, could be displayed in
more than one canvas but it doesn't make sense to paint the same HTML
document on the same canvas. The View could be a Canvas (and in fact, is
a Canvas in IE/Netscape-like browsers) but not necessarely: a voice
browser will never display the document but stil provide a View of it
using voice.

If AbstractView in fact represents the window object, shouldn't there be a "View" (presumably the implementation of "Abstract"View) and some properties underneath it, such as height and width?

AbstractView is meant to address to be the base of all possible views:
VisualView, VoiceView, etc. and it does not imply height and width. You
probably want to have a look at
http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-DOM-Level-3-Views-20001115/views-formatting.html

As of today, we still don't have plans to move further DOM Level 3 Views
and Formatting since we didn't get enough interest on the draft.
