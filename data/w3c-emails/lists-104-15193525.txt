Brad,

we revisited recently this issue. You may have noticed that the Last
Call version of DOM Events contains the following issue (Issue
keyboard-1):
[[
 Should the cancellation of a keydown prevent the textInput/keyup event
 types from being dispatched?
]]

IE, Mozilla, and Opera implementations don't generate a keypress if the
keydown is cancelled. keyup is still generated. Cancelling keyup has the
same effect as cancelling keydown.

The following section was added in the appendix on keyboard events:
[[
A.1.4 Default actions and cancelable keyboard events

Canceling the default action of a keydown/keyup event does not affect
its respective keyup/keydown event; it will however prevent the
respective textInput event from being generated. The following example
describes a possible sequence of keys to generate the Unicode character
Q (Latin Capital Letter Q) on a PC/AT US keyboard using a US mapping:

   1. {"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "keydown"}: "U+0051" (Latin
      Capital Letter Q key), shiftKey
      the default action of the keydown event is prevented.
   2. No {"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "textInput"} is
generated.
   3. {"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "keyup"}: "U+0051", shiftKey

If the key is a modifier key, the keystroke is taken into account for
the modifiers states. The following example describes a possible
sequence of keys to generate the Unicode character Q (Latin Capital
Letter Q) on a PC/AT US keyboard using a US mapping:

   1. {"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "keydown"}: "Shift",
shiftKey
      the default action of the keydown event is prevented.
   2. {"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "keydown"}: "U+0051" (Latin
      Capital Letter Q key), shiftKey
   3. {"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "textInput"}: "Q"
   4. {"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "keyup"}: "U+0051", shiftKey
   5. {"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "keyup"}: "Shift"

If the key is part of a sequence of several keystrokes, whether it is a
dead key or it is contributing to an Input Method Editor sequence, the
keystroke is not taken into account only if the default action is
canceled on the keydown event. Canceling a dead key on a keyup event as
not effect on textInput events. The following example uses the
keystrokes "U+0302" (Combining Circumflex Accent key) and "U+0045"
(Latin Capital Letter E key) (on a PC/AT french keyboard using a french
mapping and without any modifier activated):

   1. {"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "keydown"}: "U+0302"
      (Combining Circumflex Accent key)
      the default action of the keydown event is prevented.
   2. {"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "keyup"}: "U+0302"
   3. {"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "keydown"}: "U+0045" (Latin
      Capital Letter E key)
   4. {"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "textInput"}: "a"
   5. {"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "keyup"}: "U+0045"

If the key is part of a sequence of several keystrokes contributing to
an Input Method Editor sequence, the keystroke is not taken into
account.

Following this addition, we closed issue keyboard-1.
