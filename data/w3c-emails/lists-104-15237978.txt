Well, yeah, that's what I wanted to know. The detail property is undefined on 
interface KeyboardEvent and TextEvent so I can just set it to zero since the
init methods in my implementation invoke the init method of UIEvent to 
initialize their values ;)

btw, in my eyes it wasn't clear enough defined in the spec, so this should be 
explicitely said there....

Thanks,
