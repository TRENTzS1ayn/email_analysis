AbstractView is meant to address to be the base of all
possible views: VisualView, VoiceView, etc. and it does
not imply height and width. You probably want to have a
look at

http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-DOM-Level-3-Views-20001115/views-formatting.html

As of today, we still don't have plans to move further
DOM Level 3 Views and Formatting since we didn't get
enough interest on the draft.
--------------------------

What would constitute sufficient interest? I can think of several
developers with me at Hiveminds that would be very interested, at
the least... .

Many browsers are making an honest push today to implement the
standards completely exactly as they're written - but this
philanthropy runs into trouble when holes in the standards like
this are left to lie. Opera is going to add text selection to its
browser soon, but what element should .getSelection() be called
from? Having VisualView hammered out could help make this clear,
even if it's to have it well-defined yet not include selection
(driving Opera to the document element).

I won't say it's a stronger priority than say, CSS2.1 and 3,
but there's many somewhat-similar implementations out there with
no standards to work from whatsoever - just the de facto that
most involved with the W3C denounce in other areas, like coding
to the de facto IE standard of document.all.
