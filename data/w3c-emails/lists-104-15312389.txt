The draft states:

  An attribute specifying, as part of the XML declaration, the
  version number of this document. If there is no declaration,
  the value is |"1.0"|.


HTML (served as text/html) documents do not have XML declarations, and 
in this case it seems to me this propery should return null, not "1.0".  
Am I correct in making this assumption?  Or should this really be 
returning "1.0" in that case as well?
