For Python, null is mapped to the None value, which is generally used
in Python to indicate "no value".  The Python XML-SIG has gone round
and round on the issue of whether to use an empty string or None for a
missing namespace URI in the DOM, and we finally settled on None since
that's really what's intended.

This sounds like a serious nuissance in those implementations.

But I think the spec spells out clearly that null is the right thing.
If that's normally spelled using Java's null value, there's no need to
change the specification; the implementations are clearly in violation
and bug reports should be filed.
