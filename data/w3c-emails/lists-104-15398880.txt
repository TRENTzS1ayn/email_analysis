Definition NodeType:

I'm not going to say that I followed all of the discussion.  How do the 
definitions differ from XPath's axes?  Why CONTAINED_BY instead of 
ANCESTOR and CONTAINS instead of DESCENDANT?  Could there not be bits to 
indicate parent, child, attribute, sibling and self?  Is there a 
compelling reason to fabricate an order for attributes of the same 
element or for nodes in different documents?

getFeature:

It would be useful if there was some statement that if an 
DOMImplementation.hasFeature(feature, version) returns true that 
Node.getFeature(feature, version) could not return null or something 
else that would allow you to always use getFeature() and not have to try 
both getFeature() and casting.
