I know we discussed this repeatedly a VERY long time ago, but I need to
confirm my memory in order to determine whether a bug report is valid or
not:

The nodeValue of a Text node should never be null. Right?

(As I recall, we decided that the behavior if someone tried to set the Text
node's value to null this was a case of "it isn't our intent, the results
are implementation dependent, and if it hurts when you do that...")


Thanks in advance.
