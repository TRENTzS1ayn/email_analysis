(Footnote: Note that running the output of an XSLT stylesheet -- or any
other application! -- directly into a DOM may have different results than
running it through a serializer and reparsing it, precisely because some
kinds of normalization and checking may be bypassed. But I think that's a
different question than the one that was being asked.)
