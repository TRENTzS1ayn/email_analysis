The first two generate a literal #x10 as the content, the second generates
an #x10 followed by an #x13, and the last generates an #x13 only.
Newline normalization is *not* done when the characters are represented
by character references.

It was dreary and wearisome.  Cold clammy winter still held way in this
forsaken country.  The only green was the scum of livid weed on the dark
greasy surfaces of the sullen waters.  Dead grasses and rotting reeds loomed
up in the mists like ragged shadows of long-forgotten summers.
