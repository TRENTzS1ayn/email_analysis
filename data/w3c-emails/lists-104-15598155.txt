fixed.

Issue tracked using

The purpose of having NameList in the Core draft is to allow its reuse
in an other DOM module, different from the DOM Validation one. It is the
same case for DOMTimeStamp, or some exception codes.

removed "and the generated Attr nodes". Since the specified are adopted,
no Attr node is generated. Attr nodes may be generated if you have
default attributes, but this is reflected in the following sentence:
[[
Default attributes are discarded, though if the document being adopted
into defines default attributes for this element name, those are
assigned.
]]

correct. The sentence has been removed.

This inconsistency was also reported by Colin Paul Adams at:
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom/2003JulSep/0015.html
I did not add this on the Core issues list since it is an error in the
LS draft.

[Other issues were added to the Core issues list]
