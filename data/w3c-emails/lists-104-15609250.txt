It has been the case in the past, until someone realized that the Java
binding contained the following method:

boolean getWhitespaceInElementContent()

In the Java beans world, boolean attributes are mapped to setX() and
isX(), instead of of setX() and getX().

The description says:
[[
The text node is determined to contain whitespace in element content
during the load of the document or if validation occurs while using
Document.normalizeDocument().
]]

isn't that sufficient?
