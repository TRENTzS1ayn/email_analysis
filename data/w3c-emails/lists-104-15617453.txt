Correct, except that the DOM specification, since DOM Level 1,
explicitly prevents you from having Text nodes as direct children of a
Document node:

[[
The node types, and which node types they may have as children, are as
follows: 

      * Document -- Element (maximum of one), ProcessingInstruction,
        Comment, DocumentType
]]
