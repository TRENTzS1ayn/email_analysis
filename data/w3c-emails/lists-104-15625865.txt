DOM Level 1 used two words (one occurence).
DOM Level 2 used one and two words (one occurence for each).
DOM Level 3 is also using both (several occurences for each). I don't
have a personal opinion on that one. As an additional information,
googlefight tells us that "white space" wins for the moment. I would
propose following the Webster in the prose, and the Infoset for methods
and attributes naming.
