Without having spent much time with DOMError, my first interpretation of 
"fatal error" is along the lines of:

System.out.println("Fatal Error");
System.exit(1);

"fatal DOMError", "does not dispatch fatal errors to the 
DOMErrorHandler" or something along those lines would have provided a 
clue that the traditional definition was not intended.
