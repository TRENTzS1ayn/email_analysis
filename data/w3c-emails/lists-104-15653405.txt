JAXP and Xerces's seem to exclusively use "Whitespace" instead of 
"WhiteSpace" (in method definitions) and "whitespace" in prose.

The .NET frameword defines System.Xml.WhitespaceHandling, 
System.Xml.XmlWhitespace and System.Xml.XmlSignificantWhitespace but 
uses "white space" in the prose. 

MSXML defined DOMDocument.preserveWhiteSpace.

Current usage favors "Whitespace" over "WhiteSpace" in property names 
but is split on prose.
