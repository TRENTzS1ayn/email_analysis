Modified as follows:
[[
If errors occur during the invocation of this method, such as an attempt
to update a read-only node or a Node.nodeName contains an invalid
character according to the XML version in use, errors or warnings
(DOMError.SEVERITY_ERROR or DOMError.SEVERITY_WARNING) will be reported
using the DOMErrorHandler object associated with the "error-handler"
parameter. Note that this method does not report fatal errors
(DOMError.SEVERITY_FATAL_ERROR) to the DOMErrorHandler.
]]
