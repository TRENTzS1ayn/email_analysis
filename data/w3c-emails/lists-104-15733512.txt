The index is declared as unsigned.

Correct. The exceptions have been removed.

getName() can return null even before the end of the list, if wildcards
are in use for example. (as indicated in
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-DOM-Level-3-Val-20030730/validation.html#ElementEditVAL-allowedChildren)

The application can only rely on NameList.length in order to know the
end of the list.
