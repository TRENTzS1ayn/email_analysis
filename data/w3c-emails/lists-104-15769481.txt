After reading the specification, I'm a little confused about how events work for nodes such as attributes or documentFragments.  The specification says that all Nodes implement the EventTarget interface.  However, attributes and document fragments aren't a part of the document tree, according to the DOM Core specification.  So, for instance, what does it mean if one calls dispatchEvent on an attribute node?  Should the event be dispatched with the attribute's element as the 'parent' node, should some sort of exception be thrown, or should the attribute node implement EventTarget at all?
