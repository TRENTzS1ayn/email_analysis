It is correct that we did not address this requirement, despite efforts
for the DOM and UA Working Groups to come up with a solution. Past
discussions told us that more work is needed, especially at the document
level, before going further. Adding a simple DOMString property on an
event, a DOM tree containing some RDF elements, etc. is very easy to do
at the API level. It is more complex to expose such thing at the
document, i.e. in XML Events for example. Given that we still don't know
what exactly needs to be exposed in order to address your requirement,
we reached the conclusion that we wouldn't be able to address this
requirement in DOM Level 3 Events in a reasonable schedule. A future
solution might be to continue your work with the XML Events folks and
come up with a solution of what a "description" would look like.

Please, let us know if you're satisfy or not with our conclusion,

Philippe,
for the DOM WG.
