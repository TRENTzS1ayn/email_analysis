Hi Curt, 

Thank you for your comments.

I don't see how implementation may return inconsistent result..
Can you give an example of the situation you are describing?

Can you clarify your proposal, i.e. what is the purpose of index?
Using your approach how would some one ask for an implementation that
supports both "LS" and "Range" features?
Also, how can some one retrieve multiple DOM implementations if more
than one available for the set of features specified?

Thank you,
