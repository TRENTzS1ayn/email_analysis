+1 for getting a list of property names, instead of a getNextProperty or
Iterator I guess the DOM way would be something like
DOMStringList getPropertyNames();

In our application the use case is that we have a graphical tool that on
loading/ saving XML files shows all the DOM Load/ Save properties with
checkboxes, everything about that form is dynamic apart from determining
the list of properties. Once you have a property name you can determine
whether it's a boolean property, default value and what is supported
etc.

Kind regards,
