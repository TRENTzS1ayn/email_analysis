Hi,

Well, yes, it's surely nice to hear about any activity right now, but esp. in 
my case I can't do help/contribute/ nor test a Java API since I am developing 
in C++ and though all the W3C API's I implemented (or I am working on) are 
implemented in C++. I do not believe that a Java (exclusevily) designed API 
can be mapped onto other programming/scripting languages.

Is there any working draft out there yet? Because I would like to implement 
the XQuery(/XPath2) API in my library  ;)

Thanks,
Christian Parpart.
