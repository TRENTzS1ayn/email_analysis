Keyboards are generating text, so tying the keyboard events to the text
events do make sense. The reverse would certainly not be appropriate. We
removed the previous added section and added the following description
to the definitions of keydown and keyup:
[[
If cancelled (Default actions and cancelable events), a keydown cannot
contribute to the generation of text events. Whether a keydown
contributes or not to the generation of a text event is implementation
dependent.
]]

Applications should not assume that the keydown or keyup will contribute
to the text event generation.

Does this change resolve your issue?
