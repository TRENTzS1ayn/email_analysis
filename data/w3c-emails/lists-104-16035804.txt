Well, I am actually coding on a C++ library that intends to support all 
important W3C specified APIs related to DOM. I called this libXee, licenced 
unter LGPL, and I have actually implemented DOM Level 3 Core, Events, LS, 
Traversal, and XPath. While the Events module seems to be the most complete/
stable one, all other modules can be already used, as well. It is reported to 
have some XPath 1.0 implementation bugs that has not yet been fixed.

I would love to receive some comments on this implementation as I do not 
recall this as a fun project, but just can't do everything myself ;)

Project page:
http://www.surakware.net/projects/libXee/index.xml

Web CVS:
http://cvs.surakware.net/cvsweb.cgi/libXee/

I actually code unter gcc/3.2 but it is known to be compiled/run in latest 
Win32/MSVC, as well.

XPath 2.0 (/XQuery) will be implemented in libXee as soon as XPath 1.0 
is stable :)

Best regards,
