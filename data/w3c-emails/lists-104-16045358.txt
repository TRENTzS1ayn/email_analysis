We produced the attached note on how to extend the Candidate
Recommendation specification to support XPath 2.0.  This keeps all
interfaces but one -- the result object, which is substituted to
support the enhanced types, sequences, etc.  This is why the
specification returns an object instead of a specific result object
type.  The 2.0 request codes are distinct permitting an application to
support either or both and an implementation to support either or both.


For the record, I disagree with that decision. I think the evaluate() 
method should return an XPathResult. I don't think that XPath 1.0 and 
2.0 or similar enough that they can be profitably served by the same 
API, and I don't like crippling the XPath 1.0 API in service to a 
theoretical XPath 2.0 API. Please consider this a formal request that 
the evaluate() function be respecified to return XPathresult instead 
of Object.
