 From the name alone, It is surprising that XPathResult2 does not 
extend XPathResult. This conflicts, for example, with SAX's 
EntityResolver2, Locator2, etc. that all extend the original 
interface. I see the reasoning in the note that XPathResult2 does not 
extend XPathResult. That's fine. I don't disagree with it. However, 
the name suggests otherwise.

Perhaps a name change is in order? Perhaps XPath2Result would be a 
little less confusing, or perhaps something completely different like 
Sequence or XPath2Sequence, since in XPath 2.0 a sequence of one item 
is equivalent to the item itself.
