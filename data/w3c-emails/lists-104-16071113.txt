Per the XPath 2.0 Working Draft (section 2 paragraph 3):
      "The value of an expression is always a sequence".
It may be a single-value sequence, but it's a sequence.

So I'd say XPath2Sequence sounds like *exactly* the right way to model
this.

If you want to also provide a convenience API which automatically unwraps
singleton sequences, I think that's a separate question.
