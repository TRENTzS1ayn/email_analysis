I would prefer to eliminate the one for convenience completely. I 
don't think it's all that convenient, and causes significant trouble 
when the sequence that is returned has more or less than one member. 
I think it's more convenient (and much cleaner) to simple say a 
sequence is always returned. Get what you want out of it. Making 
everything a sequence is a significant simplification and improvement 
in XPath 2.0 over XPath 1.0. I think we could take advantage of this 
in the API as well.
