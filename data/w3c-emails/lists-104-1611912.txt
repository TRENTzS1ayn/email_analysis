Thanks for the reiteration.

Is there any response forthcoming on the other issue raised in http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom/2001JulSep/0225.html, that of the values for the type argument to
DocumentEvent.createEvent().  Xerces-J responds to an case-sensitive match of "Event" (interface interpretation) and Mozilla responds to a case-insensitive match of "Events" (feature interpretation)
and there is not one string that would work for both.  As described in the referenced message, the passage is vague and potentially inconsistent and either reading is reasonable.
