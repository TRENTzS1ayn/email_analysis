After discussions, there was still reluctance to ignore the fact that
keys do generate text. However, the control of the text generation
following the cancellation of a key could be a problem, as you
demonstrated with your modifier example. The consensus was to remove the
first sentence ("If cancelled, a keydown cannot contribute to the
generation of text events. ") and keep the second one:
[[
Whether a keydown/keyup
contributes or not to the generation of a text event is implementation
dependent.
]]

This statement should be enough to discourage applications to cancel
keys in order to affect the text generation imho.
