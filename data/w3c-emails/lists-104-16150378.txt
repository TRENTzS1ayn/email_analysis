correct, but no having a single String would requires passing a more
complex structure between the DOMImplementationRegistry and the
DOMImplementationSource.

We clarified the description of getDOMimplementation as follows:
[[
This method returns the first item of the list returned by
getDOMImplementationList.
]]

(note that getDOMimplementationList used to getDOMImplementations but
has been renamed)

Except that the version numbers could be ignored in the current LC
proposal:
"XML 3.0 Traversal +Events 2.0"

Traversal does not have a version number associated with it. And the
proposal introduces the parsing of 2 strings instead of one ...

This seems orthogonal to your proposal. getDOMImplementationList returns
a list of DOM implementations.
