We updated the description of the constants:
[[
 SEVERITY_ERROR
  The severity of the error described by the DOMError is error. A
  SEVERITY_ERROR may not cause the processing to stop if the error can
  be recovered, unless DOMErrorHandler.handleError() returns false.
 SEVERITY_FATAL_ERROR
  The severity of the error described by the DOMError is fatal error. A
  SEVERITY_FATAL_ERROR will cause the normal processing to stop and the
  return value of DOMErrorHandler.handleError() is ignored. If the
  implementation chooses to continue, the behavior is undefined.
 SEVERITY_WARNING
  The severity of the error described by the DOMError is warning. A
  SEVERITY_WARNING will not cause the processing to stop, unless
  DOMErrorHandler.handleError() returns false.
]]
