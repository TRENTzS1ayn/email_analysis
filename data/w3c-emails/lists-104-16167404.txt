To me, this seems quite clear, and in programming languages like Java, I expect a null value in that language to be returned.

For example, Oracle's XML parser's Node.getNamespaceURI() returns an empty (zero-length) string, and Microsoft's .NET framework (the NamespaceURI property of the System.Xml.XmlNode class) likewise returns an empty string.

If implementations returning empty strings are to be considered out-of-spec, please specify this explicitly.  If returning a zero-length string is an acceptible implementation according to the standard, please state this.  If this issue is clarified elsewhere in the DOM 3 spec, please refer to that place from the description of Node.namespaceURI.

We clarified the XML Namespaces section and replace the sentence in the
3rd paragraph with the following one:
[[
In programming languages where empty strings can be differentiated from
null, empty strings, when given as a namespace URI, are converted to
<code>null</code>.
]]

A link has been added from Node.namespaceURI to the XML namespaces
section.
