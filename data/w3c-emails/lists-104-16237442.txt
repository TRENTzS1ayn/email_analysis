done. For Java, if an attribute starts with "is" that is followed by an
upper case character, then the getter keeps the name as-is. The setter
replaces "is" with "set". Only exception is HTMLInputElement.isMap as
suggested. IsId and isWhitespaceInElementContent (now renamed to
isElementContentWhitespace) are back to be attributes again.

We renamed the method to make it clear that it reflects the Infoset
property "elenment-content-whitespace". Also added a link to the Infoset
in the description.
