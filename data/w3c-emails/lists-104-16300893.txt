The name of the method isWhitespaceInElementContent has been changed to
isElementContentWhitespace to better reflect that it refers to the
Infoset property "element-content-whitespace". Same kind of change has
been applied to the "whitespace-in-element-content" parameter. Since it
is too late to rename the Infoset property, and our method and parameter
are mapped to it, we don't plan to rename them, whatever the outcome of
the whitespace vs white space is. Regarding the prose itself, we will
happily change to whatever becomes the recommendation, and thus at any
stage.
