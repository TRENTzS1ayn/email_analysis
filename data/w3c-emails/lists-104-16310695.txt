We added a read-only attribute parameterNameList, of type DOMStringList,
on the DOMConfigurationList. This gives you the possiblity of iterating
through the parameter names supported by the object. Note that this list
can also contain parameter names defined outside the specification.,
i.e. extensions provided by the implementation.
