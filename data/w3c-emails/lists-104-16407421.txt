Hello,

These are minor editorial comments for your DOM3 Validation
Specification [1]. I thought that on the whole it looks great.

Globally, s/XML Schema/XML schema/ (unless referring to the title of
the spec) or W3C XML schema.

Decide whether or not to hyphenate subtree.

Spell APIs out the first time: APIs (Application Programming
Interfaces). I am not 100% sure if the P stands for Program, Programmer

     Users may also want to know several levels of details, e.g., all
     the possible children, those which would be valid given what
     precedes this point, lists of defined symbols of a given kind, in
     order to help in editing and creating an XML document.

     Some of these queries would prompt checks and warn you if you're
     about to conflict with or overwrite such data.

Avoid you. Who is you? Maybe:

This part:
     To some, they may edit, come up with an invalid document, then edit
     again to result in a valid document. During this process, these
     APIs can allow the user to check the validity of the document or
     sub-tree on demand; and if needed can also require that the
     document or sub-tree remain valid during this editing process via
     the DocumentEditVAL.continuousValidityChecking flag.
