Repetition is good.  That clearly indicates that the first "s" in the description of DocumentEvent.createEvent wasn't a typo.  Getting a clear statement on case-sensitivity would be good since
features are case-insensitive.  Xerces-J 1 did add support for the "s" form, but only case-sensitive.

Actually, "HTMLEvents" would fail for all XML DOM Event implementations that I know of.  If you were only wanting to use events for dispatching your own custom messages and were not dependant on
mutation events, ui events, html events. etc, then you would have to use trial and error to find out what type would give you anything that supported the Event interface.  Maybe it would be something
that could be added to DOM L3 Events.
