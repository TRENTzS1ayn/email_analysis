Dear DOM WG!

Some methods may raise several types of exceptions. It can be
situations where more then one exceptional conditions are met
at the same time. Is it described anywhere how to determine
exceptions' precedence?

For example if I try to call insertBefore method on a readonly
node with newChild being the node created from a different document,
which exception should be raised: NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR or
WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR?

Thanks.

Yours sincerely,
Vadim.
