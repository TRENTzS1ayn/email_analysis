which goes like this:

"rows of type HTMLCollection, readonly
    Returns a collection of all the rows in the table, including all in 
THEAD, TFOOT, all TBODY elements."

Now, such collection will be order in which manner? According to document 
order where TFOOT occurs *before* TBODY ...
or according to display order.
The TR document does not say and right now known browsers do not agree.
