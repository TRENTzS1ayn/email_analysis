That shows that several folk raised the issue of  that
change introducing an asymmetry with respect to
addEventListener(), which should have been dealt
with at the same time.

I think the corresponding change on the addEventListener
side is a guarantee that a listener added to the current
node _will_ be invoked as appropriate.  That still leaves
the order of event delivery loosely defined, but doesn't
create a surprise in the API model.  (And it'd certainly
reduce implementation complexity.)
