It could be argued that synchronous DOMParser is not required to implement the events::EventTarget and so it should not be a forced to implement one. In that case, a possible solution is to have a generic DOMParser interface and two other interfaces namely DOMParserSynchronous and DOMParserAsynchronous which extends DOMParser. Then the DOMParserAsynchronous could be made to implement the events::EventTarget interface. 

The DOM WG discussed this and given that the spec currently follows 
what's done in every other case where DOM objects are expected to be 
event targets, it was decided to leave the spec unchanged.
