I don't know, I found some of the wording of the wholeText stuff a little
hairy too!

I can't speak for the Editors, but this is my understanding of
replaceWholeText and how I have implemented it in pxdom.

The return value. If the whole text is replaced by no text, there will
be no Text node left to return, which is why we get null.

N4, containing text 'some text'. N1, N2 and N3 will be removed from the
document. In N2's case its parent EntityReference will be removed instead
of N2 itself (assuming that is the reason for N2 being readonly).
