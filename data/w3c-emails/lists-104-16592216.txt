The current description says
"This is null when unspecified."

As you realized, the xmlEncoding is the encoding from the XML
declaration so xmlEncoding retain the value from the declaration. I
don't think I can do better than saying "An attribute specifying, as
part of the XML declaration, the encoding of this document." on that one
(with a link from "XML declaration" to
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml#NT-XMLDecl). actualEncoding (soon to be
renamed to inputEncoding) will be UTF-16, since it as parsed from a
source string. If parsed from a character stream, then it depends where
the implementation is able to determine the encoding by the character
stream.
