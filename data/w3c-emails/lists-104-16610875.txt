yes, but it would increase the complexity of the API by forcing it to
represent the complex structure.

Having the ability to have more than one implementation represented in
an implementation source is considered important. and regarding the use
of getDOMImplementationList, ...

... this is a mistake and the implementation of
DOMImplementationRegistry.getDOMImplementationList needs to be fixed to
use the method DOMImplementationSource.getDOMImplementationList.
