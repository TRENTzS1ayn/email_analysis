When more than one exception is possible, then it doesn't matter which
one your implementation chooses to throw, as long as it raises one of
them.

"NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR or WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR" is the answer. Since
you're in a programming error case (i.e. the application tried to an
illegal action), it doesn't which exception your implementation will
throw.
