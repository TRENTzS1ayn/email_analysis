The DOM WG discussed this issue and decided to specify that when writing 
to a HTTP URI, a HTTP PUT is always performed. For other typs of URIs, 
the mechanism for writing the data to the URI is implementation 
dependent. The WG did not want to extend the API to let the user specify 
a content type, though it was decided to make the spec state that the 
implementation is expected to make the implementation responsible of 
associating the appropriate media type with the serialized data. As for 
charset, use DOMSerializer.write() and specify the charset in the 
DOMOutput. (DOMSerializer.writeURI() is now simply a convenience method 
that acts as if calling write(), passing the uri using the DOMOutput 
argument).
