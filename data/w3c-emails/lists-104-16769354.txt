After consideing this issue, and the other issues that we've got against 
DocumentLS and ElementLS, the DOM WG decided to drop these interfaces 
from the LS specification. The strongest reason for dropping these 
interfaces is the fact that the DOM WG doesn't believe it will get two 
implementations of these interfaces, and that's needed to exit CR for 
this spec. That, and the fact that the issues raised against these 
interfaces are non-trivial and time consuming to solve, made the DOM WG 
decide to drop these interfaces.
