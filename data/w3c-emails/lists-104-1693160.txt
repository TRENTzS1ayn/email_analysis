You seem to think that's a bad thing; why?  There's cognitive
science behind that principle, as well as years of practical
experience.  Self-inconsistent models are error prone; special
cases tend to make bugs happen.

More people trip over the pavement that's raised an
extra few inches (say, by a root) than over the flat stuff.

I don't seem to have a message from Phillipe with any
reasons.  The archive discussion doesn't address that
issue (that is, it was raised a couple times but ignored).

... "meaning a copy ... is used".  Sure looks to me like
you said the two concepts are one and the same.

You lost me there.  "Atomic" has clear technical meaning,
"same model" has one that seems clear in context.  You did
not respond to either aspect.  Were you responding to some
other post, which used a "fighting word" like "ugly"?

And that's irrelevant to the consistency issue, which was raised
along with the original proposal yet which is still unresolved.
