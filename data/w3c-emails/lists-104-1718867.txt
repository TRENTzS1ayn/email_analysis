Folks, what Philippe has pointed out is that a decision actually was made;
the spec says what we meant to say, and there were legitimate reasons
behind that decision. I agree it's a bit ugly, but it isn't an Erratum and
we really can't change it without a better reason than aesthetics.

A FAQ entry might be called for. I'm probably not the best person to write
this one, but if folks think it's needed and nobody else steps up I'll take
a stab at it.
