I guess we lost interest in moving forward the second edition of the DOM
Level 1 specification given than DOM Level 2 is out and contains all the
errata. so, for the moment and unless someone complains, there is no plan
to publish DOM 1 SE.

Someone else asked regarding the DOM Level 2 HTML WD. We are still working on
it even if we're not really active in this area for the moment. We are dealing
with backward compatibilities with DOM Level 1 HTML...
