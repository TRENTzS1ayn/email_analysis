right.

I would expect it to return empty string and use getPropertyValue to
check if a value was specified or not.

What about this new wording?

Used to retrieve the priority of a CSS property (e.g. the "important"
qualifier) if the priority has been explicitly set in this declaration
block.

Return Value: A string representing the priority (e.g. "important") if
the priority has been explicitly set in this declaration block. The
empty string if not.
