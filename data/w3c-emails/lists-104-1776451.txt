Philippe,

Your proposed new wording is okay with me.  I'd be even more explicit,
however.  For example:

  Return Value: A string representing the priority (e.g. "important") if
  the property has been explicitly set in this declaration block and has a
  priority specified.  The empty string otherwise.
