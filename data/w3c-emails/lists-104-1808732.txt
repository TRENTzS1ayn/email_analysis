Yes, I am now confused too. I was under the impression that Events
may be recycled and that initEvent, initUIEvent, etc might be called on
an event many times on events that have been dispatched and returned.
I suppose I'm making this assumption because there would be no need
for an initEvent method at all if it could only be called once (you could
just pass the initialisation parameters to the createEvent method) and
because initEvent may be used to initialise "only the values specified in
initEvent" (meaning you might re-initEvent an existing UIEvent?). If it is
intended that this method never be called after it has been dispatched
then perhaps it should be stated more clearly? The part about "though
it may be called multiple times during that phase if necessary" is
confusing. During what phase? The dispatchEvent "phase" or something
that has to do with phaseType?
