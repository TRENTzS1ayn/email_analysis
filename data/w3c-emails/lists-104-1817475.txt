The "MutationEvents" module of the DOM Level 2 Events spec defines an
event type named "DOMCharacterDataModified".  However, in the discussion
of the newValue and prevValue properties of the MutationEvent object,
this event type is called "DOMCharDataModified".

I assume that the correct name is DOMCharacterDataModified.  Can anyone
confirm or deny this?

David
