No. DOMSubtreeModified is fired in addition to more specific mutation
events. The intent was to indicate that some applications may find that
listening only for DOMSubtreeModified suffices for their needs.

As I read/remember it: Yes and no. The only promise made is that
DOMSubtreeModified will eventually be fired after the DOM has been altered.
It may be more often, or less often,  than once per DOM method call, " at
the implementation's discretion." I expect that most implementations will
tend to favor the once-per-method interpretation, but that may not be
convenient for the logic of some, and may be overkill for others which know
these method calls are part of a higher-level operation.
