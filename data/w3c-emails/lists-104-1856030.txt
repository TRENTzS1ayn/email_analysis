Minor clerical issue.  It would be helpful if the XML sources for DOM L3 distinguished between interfaces that the DOM implementation is expected to provide (almost all interfaces) and the few that the application might provide (EventListener, for example).  Just some other little attribute on the <interface> element that is usually omitted would be all that is necessary.
