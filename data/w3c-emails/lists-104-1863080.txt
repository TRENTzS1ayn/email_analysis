Thanks for the clarification, Joe.

Then let me suggest that the phrase "It can be used" is misleading and
ought to be clarified.  The rest of this section of the spec is
addressed to DOM implementors and tells them when their implementation
must fire events.  This one sentence isn't an instruction to
implementors, but instead a suggestion to DOM programmers.  This context
switch really tripped me up.

I suggest that the sentence be changed to read:

  Clients of the DOM may prefer to listen for events of this type
  instead of the more specific event types listed below.
