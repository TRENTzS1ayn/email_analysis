Hi,

a quick question.

Is getElementsByTagNameNS supposed to be able to find elements that are in
no namespace? If yes, how? It seems that Xerces accepts null as
namespaceUri, which seems to be right.

If getElementsByTagNameNS can not match elements which aren't in a
namespace, what's the behaviour of the DOM level 1 method
getElementsByTagName? From what I read it will ignore the namespaceUri and
will only check the name, making it useless for documents where namespaced
elements occur...

Julian
