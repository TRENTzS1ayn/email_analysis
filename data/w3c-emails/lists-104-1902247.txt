It doesn't address the recent issues raised on the DOM public
mailing list but should address all issues raised more than
3 weeks ago.

Note to the User Agent Accessibility Guidelines Working Group:

This new version addresses the action item to the DOM WG from
our co-meeting at the technical plenary meeting [1]:
"Action on DOM: We will look at adding enumeration."

You are now able to iterate through the list of listeners:

Bests regards,
