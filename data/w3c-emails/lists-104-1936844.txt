The WAI folks would like to have access to scripting semantics and activation
schemes, and thus have access to scripting or role of each event attached to
element. the EventListener list improves a bit the situation. We cannot provide
a documentation on event handlers to describe what they do, tough. We're going to
reconsider the security concerns.
