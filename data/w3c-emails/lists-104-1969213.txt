1.2.2. Event capture

"A capturing EventListener will not be triggered by events dispatched
directly to the EventTarget upon which it is registered."

Could you point me to the text that describes how you dispatch an event
directly to the EventTarget? I can't find it by inspection, but it's
probably staring me in the face.

Thanks!
