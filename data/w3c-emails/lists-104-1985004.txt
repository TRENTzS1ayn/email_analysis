Well, it says there " If neither event capture or event bubbling are in use
for that
particular event,..." I can find text that says how you prevent bubbling for
a particular event (you set 'bubbling' to false in the object that
represents the event), but not how to prevent capture.

Event *listeners* can choose not to capture, but I don't see how *events
themselves* can choose not to be captured.

Thanks!
