Oh.  I see what you mean.  I don't think you can switch off capture.

I read this to mean "If there are no capturing event listeners
registered for events of this type on ancestors of the target event, and
if it is of a type that does not bubbble..."

Maybe the section should be reworded for clarity in Level 3?
