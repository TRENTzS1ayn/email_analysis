That's what I thought, but the text "A capturing EventListener
will not be triggered by events dispatched directly to the EventTarget upon
which it is registered." made it sound if there was (I thought there was
something special about 'direct dispatching' vs 'capture dispatching'.) But
I understand now that I misread it.
"A capturing EventListener will not be triggered by events dispatched
directly to the EventTarget upon which it is registered." means that the
'capture phase' and the 'target phase' are distinct.

I think that part of my confusion is generated by saying there is a basic
flow, and then there is event capture, and then there is bubbling. In fact
capture is part of the basic flow, not some extra that happens in special
circumstances.

"If neither event capture or event bubbling are in use for that
particular event, the event flow process will complete after all
listeners have been triggered. If event capture or event bubbling
is in use, the event flow will be modified as described in the
sections below."

This text is plain misleading. Event bubbling *is* an option, but event
capture is not. Since you can find text that shows how to make bubbling
optional, it sends you searching for the equivalent method for capture.

Basic event flow is *not* modified if event capture is in use; event capture
is *always* in use.

Thanks for clearing that up for me!
