I believe the current phrasing is adequate and generally understood.

Actually, there is nothing in the DOM spec that ensures that identity
comparision between nodes is meaningful.  DOM L3 is considering adding an
isSameNode() function to allow node identity comparisons.  A node can be
appropriate and the condition can be true (likely) or false (less likely)
and a node can be inappropriate and the condition true (less likey) or false
(likely).

Xerces knows that any node object that was created by the document (either
through a call to a document create* method or returned by a public method)
will implement NodeImpl and instanceOf NodeImpl is false, it is certain that
the node was not created by the document but is from another implementation.

Any object that implements org.w3c.dom.Node but isn't an subclass of
org.apache.xerces.NodeImpl was not created by the Document.

Passing an object from a different implementation is more than just a wrong
document and a different type of exception is not unexpected.

The public interfaces do not attempt to interfaces that would allow you to
provide your own implementation of Node.

p.s. Just an interested observer, not a W3C or DOM WG member
