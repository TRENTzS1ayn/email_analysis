Any DOM has the same type of requirement.  The issue is that there are
behaviors required by the DOM spec that can't be implemented in terms
of the public APIs.  Well known to any implementor.  It complicates the
task of testing, too, since triggering the behaviors (creating readonly nodes,
as one example) also requires behaviors out of scope of the spec.

Would it be a Good Thing if the public interfaces were sufficient
for such purposes -- both implementation and testing?
