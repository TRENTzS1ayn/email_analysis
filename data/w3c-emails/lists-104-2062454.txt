The DOM, per se, should _NEVER_ strip whitespace. It represents whatever
it's told to represent. If you're having a problem with this, talk to
whoever wrote your DOM implementation, or (more likely) whoever wrote the
code that is building the DOM (the parser or whatever else is acting as a
DOM source).
