Trying to do it in the general case would mean imposing unacceptable
constraints on implementation.

The "Embedded DOM" chapter of DOM Level 3 was going to consider the
question of combining nodes from different implementations into a single
tree. This turns out to be a very ugly problem, and this feature has
trimmed itself down and will only support nodes which are subclassed from
the same DOM implementation. If there's a serious requirement that it do
more, you may want to take that up with the EDOM editorial team and provide
some help on brainstorming how this could be made to work properly. (First
show that it's needed. Then show that it's possible...)
