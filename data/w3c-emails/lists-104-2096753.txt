Or, the DOM implementation uses node->normalize() function which removes 
the whitespaces and joins all adjacent text nodes. An expected 
normalization of the nodes is taken into considereation by I18N Working 
Group, as is stated on the DOM core website.

Is the user's job to preserve whitespaces (e.g) for correct output when 
using DOM implementations?

I'm new on this mail-list, so forgive me if i'm asking something that 
already was asked, but i didn't quite finished browsing all the articles in 
the mail-list...
