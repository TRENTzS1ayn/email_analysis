Can anybody tell me why there are DOMStrings defined in the Attr interface 
for name and value of an attribute? Since Attr is inherited from node, 
which successfully holds nodeName and nodeValue fields, why are those 
fields again present in the Attr?

Or, do they have a different meaning from those in Node?
And, on setting the value of an attribute, the DOM Core specifies that a 
new Text node is created for that value... Then what does "value" field 
holds if a Text node already contains the attribute's value?

Forgive me if these questions have already been asked...

Thank you.
