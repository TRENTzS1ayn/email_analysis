"DOM Level 0" compatability.  They're identical to and interoperable with
the corresponding Node properties.

Don't confuse IDL attributes with fields. Everything in the DOM should be
considered an abstract interface, and most things that look like fields
should be considered accessors. In specific, reading an Attr node's value
returns the concatenation of the contents of all contained Text nodes,
while writing replaces the contents with a single text node having the new
value.
