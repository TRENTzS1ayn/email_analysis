hi

the ids are specified, and were recognized.  but the actual problem was not
that.

I could manage to get my thing done, but still the original problem remains.

What I was trying to do was, I was trying to read the background color of a
particular cell (td).  And then I was trying to change it.  But I couldn't
even read it using either directly or through style object.

say,
document.getElementById("id of td").bgcolor
document.getElementById("id of td").style.background-color

none of them are giving non null results.  I don't know why??? Can someone
throw some light..


regards

raghav..

Ehmmm...could be many things - maybe you could be more specific. Do the
elements have ID attributes according to the dtd? Are they read in or
generated (in the latter case, they won't be recognized as ID attributes)?

Ta, Evert

Hi all
I have been trying to handle a table's attributes dynamically using
getElementById() but couldn't succeed.
can anybody help me understand the reason..
Is table a static element that doesn't support runtime behaviour of this
type. or am I missing something on my part..
