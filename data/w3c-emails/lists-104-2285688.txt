(1) is addressed in DOM Level 3 AS [2]. Our DataType includes XML Schemas
    and (will include in the next public version) DTD datatypes and thus is a
    superset of the [attribute type] provided in the Infoset.
(2) [Notation Information items] are DOM Level 3 Core. The
    [declaration base URI] and [base URI] are represented by the same
    IDL attribute in the Node interface [1]. Regarding unparsed entities,
    unparsed entities are in DOM Level 3 AS [4].    
(3) [base URI] is already addressed in DOM Level 3 Core [1].

Next public version of Core will provide the mapping between Infoset and
DOM3 Core.

[all declarations processed]
 No plan to include this Infoset property in DOM Level 3 for the moment. I guess
 if you are able to come up with a good use case, it could be added in
 DOM Level 3 AS.
[namespace attributes]
 As you know, DOM Level 1 & 2 are already exposing them in the attributes list.
 LS provides an option to not have them in the list and thus be compatible with
 the Infoset. We didn't find any good reason to expose them separately.
[in-scope namespaces]
 We carefully considered exposing the [in-scope namespace] in Core, essentially
 to have them for the XPath DOM. We concluded that XPath DOM wasn't a sufficient
 reason to expose in the DOM and impose this new cost on all DOM Core
 implementations. We added them in the XPath DOM [5] but are open to suggestions
 (and *really* good reasons) to move them in the Core.

For XPath, [in-scope namespaces] can be obtained using the XPath DOM or inferred
from the Core if you don't need to expose them as Nodes.
For XInclude, [base URI] is already in the Core. Implementing XInclude is a
not-so-easy step in current XML processors. The DOM WG postponed the support
of XML Include in the DOM API [6] given the unknown impacts on the AS and LS
modules.

Given that the DOM Core is the central part of the DOM API, we have been careful
on not imposing there the cost of a specific of applications. This was, for
example,
our main motivation to not include the namespace nodes in the Core. In the
set of Information item properties, only a few of them cannot be inferred by the
Core and we don't plan to include them directly in the Core unless someone is
able to come up with good use cases.

XSLT was one of the use case for the XPath DOM and XPointer has also a dependency
on XPath.
