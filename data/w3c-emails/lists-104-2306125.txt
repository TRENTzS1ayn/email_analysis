This functionality is already expressed in Level 3 core in the Node 
interface.  By keeping the XPath version of the interface abstract, we 
permit applications to construct maps for cases where the namespace 
context is not based upon a Node in the hierarchy (although we do not 
have a create method for that type of object).  There are other 
differences, such as one you stumbled on:  XPath never requires the 
default namespace (and requiring XPathNamespaceResolver to supply it 
might make the implementer erroneously apply it to prefixless names 
within the expression).
