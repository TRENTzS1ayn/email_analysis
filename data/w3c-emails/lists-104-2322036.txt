Greetings to the W3C DOM Working Group, WWW-DOM List Members, DIRECT-L List
Members, and Lingo-L List Members:

At this time I would like to announce the immediate availability of the
first Public Preview Release of "DOM-Lingo" at
http://www.devhq.com/dom-lingo/.

DOM-Lingo is a binding of the Lingo scripting lanaguage used by Macromedia's
Director Shockwave Studio [1] to the W3C Document Object Model [2] (DOM) IDL
interfaces, and an implementation of the DOM Level 2 specification [3].

DOM-Lingo takes full advantage of the power of Macromedia Director and the
Lingo scripting language. It includes all the "parent scripts" necessary to
implement the Core, XML, Traversal and Range modules of the DOM
specification. With it, XML [4] document trees can be created from scratch
or generated from parsed XML documents, manipulated via the DOM in memory,
traversed, iterated and serialized/printed.

DOM-Lingo does not require the XML Parser Xtra [5]. It includes a robust,
non-validating XML processor written entirely in Lingo. The processor
creates DOM-Lingo node trees from valid XML documents located in memory, on
a local drive, or at a remote URL. The DOM-Lingo XML processor is currently
the only comprehensive XML processor available for Director/Shockwave.
 
DOM-Lingo includes support for the TreeWalker and NodeIterator interfaces
from the DOM's Traversal and Range [6] modules for quick and efficient
traversal of XML document trees. The NodeFilter interface is also supported
to provide exacting specificity in node visibility. Both a brief technical
overview and a complete implementation listing are available at the
DOM-Lingo website.

The Public Preview Release is free, and the source is open. When the
implementation and conformance phases are complete, DOM-Lingo will be made
available under license only as a "protected external cast".

DOM-Lingo requires Macromedia Director 7.0.2 or later. Macromedia Director
8.0 Shockwave Studio is recommended.

Inquiries may be directed to Christopher Watson via email at
cwatson@lightspan.com, or by telephone at (858) 824-8457.

Sincerely,

Christopher Watson
Developer, DOM-Lingo
