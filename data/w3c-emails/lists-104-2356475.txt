>Since null and "" are indistinguishable on some bindings

See previous discussion:  there are pre-existing places where the
distinction may be meaningful, and the binding which chooses to create this
situation is responsible for deciding how it will be handled. (Note that it
_IS_ a choice, since a reserved value other than "" could have been used to
represent the null string. Given Unicode, it isn't hard to come up with a
string which is exceedingly unlikely to ever collide with actual data!)
