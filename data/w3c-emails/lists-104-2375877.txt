Actually, in that context you wouldn't even need to go to Unicode
characters, you could use the return value "#default" when the URI matches
the default namespace and leave "" for no match.

The design of element.getAttribute() seems to have anticipated the problem
by explicitly returning "" instead of null when the attribute name is not
found.

For already recommended methods, there needs to be a resolution that
accomodates the deployed implementations where Java implementations return
null and ECMAScript implementations return "".  However, for L3 methods,
avoiding the use of null DOMString parameters and attributes in the
definition would preempt having to deal with it in the bindings.
