Many consider that a wart.  It made us require another method to test 
for attribute existence.

If I am not mistaken, ECMAScript implementations which substitute "" 
where the spec says null are broken.  That does not preclude other 
bindings from making that substitution where required, but the 
ECMAScript binding does not require it.  Log a bug against mozilla and 
vote for it.  I was told it is clearly broken behavior.
