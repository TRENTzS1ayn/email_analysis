Hi all,
           I've 2 frames say "top" and "bottom". Frame "Top" having
following HTML.
                                   <html>

<head><title>Title</title></head>
                                              <body><table>

<tr><td>Name</td><td>Pranav</td></tr>

<tr><td>Company</td><td>Informica</td></tr>
                                             </table></body>
                                 < /html>

               Now I wann to read values(Name=Pranav and Company=Informica)
from "Top" frame and want to use these values in the "Bottom" frame.
                Can is it possible with the help of DOM or by another way???

Waiting for reply...
