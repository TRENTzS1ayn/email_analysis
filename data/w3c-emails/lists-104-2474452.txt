Any chance that you can put this 1.7MB file somewhere online (better - 
zip'ed) so we can test with different browsers?
Konqueror (www.konqueror.org) has very good DOM-, CSS2- based "KHTML" engine, 
and I can't say I have ever seen such (50mb) memory usage with it. ( I tested 
it on a 1.8MB bug archive file from bugs.kde.org, everything was fine)
But of course it can vary depending on file structure.
Anyway, I am ready to test with Konqi your file, and tell you what exactly 
memory usage was.
