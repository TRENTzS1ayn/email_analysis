Ok, I see.
May I ask you to try this file/link:
http://bugs.kde.org/db/ix/full.html
(it's exactly what I have on disk, but from Jan.5th, 2001; so current version 
may vary)
As I do not meet every day new people doing own (new) DOM implementation, I 
am very interested in work you done :-)
So, what will be memory usage/speed of your DOM implementation for URL above?

BTW: if you are interested in different DOM implementation(s), I highly 
recommend to take a look on KHTML. It's Object-Oriented, C++-based. Works 
pretty fast.
