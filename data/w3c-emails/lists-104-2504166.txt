We removed the DOMKey property and worked again on how to resolve
the user data requirement [1]. We also reworked the document order
requirement and dropped it for the moment. Tree position has been
extended (constant names to be finalized). The mapping from DOM to
Infoset is now completely documented (check angle brackets items in
the  index for the complete supported list). equaslNode definition has
been clarified ([2] was on our agenda for quite a long time). The
bootstrapping in ECMAScript is now complete. Note that we moved the
error handling system in the Core for future usage in the normalization
method (for the moment called normalizeNS but we are working on a larger
goal: "superDuperNormalize"). Case sensitivity still needs some work.
We dropped "getElementsByAttributeValue" and  "a way to allow text
documents" requirements [1]. We've done some of [3]. Comment regarding
hasFeature and previous versions [4] is also addressed in this draft.
