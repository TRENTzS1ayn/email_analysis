may be off topic, apologies.

I am having problems finding a code snippet, or other info regarding how one
identifies which element has been 'tabbed to', by using the tab key. For
instance: one has a number of img on  a page, and wish to know the id or
name of the one which has focus. event.srcElement.name works for many
events, but does not seem to for this one.
