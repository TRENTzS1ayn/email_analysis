Somebody have already implied that this is independent of the DOM
specification, 
and to me this seems rather like a problem with the import implementation.

If the mechanism for importing an XML file into the proprieteray internal
structure
is using SAX, (which seems to be a good and widespread practice) then this
can be customized 
by the application programmer in the sense that he writes his own XMLReader
for 
XML text-files. (To make it simple the application programmer should perhaps
use an
existing xml parser)
This is of course more work for the application programmer....

But there's always a balance between usage of human resources and
OS-resources... :-)
