I think the approach taken so far is correct. The root node belongs only to 
the document object and this one has to manage it.
Even if any node cannot live outside the Document node, i don't think that 
an element should be allowed to modify the structure of the document in 
which resides. I think this is a good separation, even if the coding gets 
somehow ugly following this approach (i agree to that).
A compromise approach would be to introduce a special node object in the 
DOM, called RootElement, or something like that, but i don't think it is 
worthing to go that way.
