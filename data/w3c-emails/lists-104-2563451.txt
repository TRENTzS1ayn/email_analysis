DOM Level 3 has been looking at this. There are some slightly ugly issues
regarding the fact that some DOMs may want to subclass themselves based on
the DTD and/or the root element's namespace, so there are definitely cases
where you do _not_ want to allow the document to be created before the root
element is known... but there are also cases where it's more reasonable, so
the DOM may be able to permit it for _some_ implementations. Still being
researched, as far as I know.

Meanwhile, all I can suggest is buffering the incoming data -- or otherwise
looking ahead -- to obtain the information required by createDocument
before it's needed.
