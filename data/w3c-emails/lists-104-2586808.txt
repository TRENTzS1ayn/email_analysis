By one interpretation, CDATASection is a subclass of Text.  Therefore, a 
CDATASection is a Text,
so the first text to be returned would be " one  ".  This was certainly 
the intent of the specification in this
case, although it is not clear to me that the specification is always 
careful that when it says Text, it can
mean Text or CDATASection.  It might be clearer to refer to these by 
node type instead of by
interface, but I am not sure what impact that approach would have on the 
clarity of the specification if
it were applied throughout the specification.
