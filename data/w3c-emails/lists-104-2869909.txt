I wish to build a large (SQL intensive) Document in concurrent threads.

My idea is to create a Document and attach the first level child nodes.

I will then create 1 thread per child node and pass each child node to the
routines that will build them.

I then wait for all threads to complete.

Is this technique thread safe? My assumption is that it should be because
each thread is appending children onto its "own" node.

If it is not thread safe - can I easily make it so.

Many thanks

Mark
