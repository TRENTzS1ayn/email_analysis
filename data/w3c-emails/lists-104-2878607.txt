Check the documentation for your DOM implementation. The DOM spec does not
guarantee that multitasking will be supported. Most existing DOM
implementations are not threadsafe; a few are, and a few have documented
what you can and can't get away with.

If yours isn't safe, adding the appropriate semaphores in your application
code to protect an unsafe implementation will probably be possible, just as
with any non-thread-safe data structure. Again, check your implementation's
docs.
