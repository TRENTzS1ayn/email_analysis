Hi,

I am trying to find mouse position with javascript, and cannot figure out
the DOM way to call clientx and clienty. I have versions that work with
particular browsers, but not all:

IE:
document.mousetest.mousexy.value = event.clientX

Mozilla:
document.mousetest.mousexy.value = ev.clientX

Pointers to an appropriate guide would be much appreiciated - I have looked
at http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-DOM-Level-2-19990304/events.html, but have
not known how to implement it.

Cheers,

Dave Balch
