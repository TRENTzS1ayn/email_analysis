This is indeed the standard DOM way of reading it. Lack of browser
support is another issue - which browsers are you concerned with?

Note that clientX isn't generally especially useful unless you happen to
know that your page hasn't been scrolled. Quite why a screen-relative
and window-relative position were included in DOM events but not a
page-relative one (which is the one useful to web page authors 99% of
the time) is quite beyond me.
