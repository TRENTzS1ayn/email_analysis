In the Text Nodes section, I'm a little unsure about how entity
references are to be handled. The spec says "may have multiple fragmented
Text nodes due to cdata sections, entity references, etc.", but does this
mean that entity references are treated as text nodes? Or when looking for
text nodes, should entity references be expanded (or recursively
traversed, looking at their content, as if they were expanded)? Thanks for
pointing me in the right direction.
