I'm still a little unclear, say I declare:

<!ENTITY % bit "bit">
<!ENTITY middle "middle %bit;">

And then I have the following XML fragment:

<top>
This is the &middle; part
</top>

So if I did "/top/text()" what would be returned? Would it be:

1) "This is the"
2) "This is the" and "part"
3) "This is the" and "middle bit" and "part"
4) Something else?

Thanks for the help.
