In your example, "/top/text()" would return a pointer to the Text node
containing "This is the " (don't forget the trailing space). Your
application could (and presumably would, if you aren't interested in the
details of the DOM structure) then call that object's wholeText() method
rather than retrieving its value/data, which would yield the DOMString
"This is the middle bit part".

(Note that since CDATASection inherits from Text, it too supports the
wholeText() operation.)
