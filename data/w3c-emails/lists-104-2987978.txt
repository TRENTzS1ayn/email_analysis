>(the one with namespaces).

Simple advice: Use the Level 2 calls.

The Level 1 calls are still there only because we wanted Level 2 parsers
(and other DOM sources) to be downward-compatable with old Level 1
applications. Elements and attributes created with the Level
1non-namespaced methods are _not_ fully upward compatable with Level 2
code; don't bother trying.
