Ditto the GNUJAXP version of DOM (evolved from what seems to have been
the first generally available implementation of DOM Level 2 in Java).  In

http://savannah.gnu.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/classpathx/jaxp/source/gnu/xml/dom/

DomAttr and DomNamedNodeMap classes ... also linear searches, on
the grounds that most XML documents don't use very many attributes.

Results compatible with both views are needed at the same time,
another reason to stick to simpler data structures.
