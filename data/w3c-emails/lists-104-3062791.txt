hi,
 
 i'm using msxml3 in my vb application. Here i require to  write an XML
in VB. i have some questions regarding this 
   1) can mxxml.xmlwriter be used for this 
   2) where can i get some code samples of this.
    
the xml  that i'm constructing is simple it just requires  node names
and value , no attributes etc
Presently i'm writing a string in VB which is not very elegant.
 
thanx in Advance
 
Pradyumna
