What exception should be raised if you for instance call 
Comment::replaceChild or Comment::insertBefore (probably not only these).

Should my implementation raise HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR or NOT_FOUND_ERR?

I guess it is NOT_FOUND_ERR (?) (Since a comment can't have children)

I can't find anything about this issue in the specification...

Best regards
