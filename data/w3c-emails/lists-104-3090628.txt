(My apologies if this has come up before, I looked with google as
suggested on the mail archives page but could not find a similar
question)

Hi there,

My question is whether
Document.createTextNode(null)
is allowed (the same goes for CharacterData.setData(null)).

I could not find anything in the specification that disallows it.
If it is allowed, what should happen when I do (in the Java-binding)
Text someText = document.createTextNode(null);
System.out.println(someText.getLength());
System.out.println(someText.getData());
someText.appendData("bar");
System.out.println(someText.getData());
And what do I do on serialization in load/ save?

If it isn't allowed, what exception should I throw?

(currently, we simply allow it to be null, although appendData dies)

Kind regards,

--Sander.
