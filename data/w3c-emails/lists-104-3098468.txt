Hi!
  I am using Microsoft's XML Parser.
  My question is..
  Is there any way, by which I can load only
  a part of a document in memory using load method.
  of the "DOMDocument" interface.
  As I want to search in only a part of a document,
  I want to load only a part of that document.
  Because my document can be really big, loading complete
  document is going to be really bad for me. 
  Please tell me ..is there any way..?
   
     regards 
Santosh Moholkar.
