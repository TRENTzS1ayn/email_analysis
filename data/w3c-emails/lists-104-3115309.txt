Questions on a specific implementation should be asked in the appropriate
forum, in this case the newsgroup public.microsoft.xml (also available
through http://msdn.microsoft.com)

I don't believe there is a practical way to have MSXML create a object model
for part of a document.  It is possible in parsers that layer DOM on top of
SAX (most likely candidate on Microsoft platforms would be Xerces-C) where
you can add a filter between the layers that discard parts of the document
you are not interest in.  Or you may be able to accomplish your objectives
using the SAX interfaces of MSXML.
