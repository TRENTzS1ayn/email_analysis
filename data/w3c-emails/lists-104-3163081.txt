It took us a long time to come up with a new version of this
DOM Level 2 Working Draft but here it is:

http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-DOM-Level-2-HTML-20011025

Changes from DOM Level 1 can be found at
http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-DOM-Level-2-HTML-20011025/changes.html

Note that the DOM Level 2 HTML module is NOT backward compatible with
the DOM Level 1 HTML module.

Backward compatibility with "DOM Level 0" is one of the major requirements
of the DOM HTML module. Due to an editiorial error in DOM Level 1 HTML,
the DOM Level 1 HTML module is not backward compatible with "DOM Level 0"
and prevents the major Web browsers, including Web Browsers for televisions,
to respect the conformance with the specification. The errors were reported
during the Candidate Recommendation phase of DOM Level 2 and the DOM Working
Group made the decision to stop the DOM Level 2 HTML module on his way
to Recommendation. After discussion, it has been decided to produce a new
version of the DOM HTML without backward compatibility support of DOM Level 1
HTML.

Major changes are on the HTMLImageElement interface:
 The lowSrc attribute has been removed.
 The types of the attributes border, height, hspace, width and vspace have
 been changed from DOMString to long.

With this new update, the DOM Working Group is also proposing to allow
use of the DOM HTML with XHTML 1.0 documents. However, there is no consensus
within W3C Working Groups for this proposal. Comments are highly welcome.
