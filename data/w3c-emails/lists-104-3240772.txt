Hi,

the mothod description for DOM Level 2 Core Document::createElement
contains:

"In addition, if there are known attributes with default values, Attr
[p.51] nodes representing them are automatically created and attached to
the element."

The method description for Document::createElementNS however does not
contain a similar statement. Are these methods really supposed to behave
differently with regard to default attributes?

And finally, what does "there are known attributes with default values"
mean exactly. I think this is a requirement to create such Attributes in a
document that has been validated by the parser. However, a DOM
implementation might also have access to <!ATTLIST ...> declarations in
the internal subset, even if the document has only been parsed for
wellformedness. Should it also create the default attributes in this case?

Bye,

Tobias Peters
