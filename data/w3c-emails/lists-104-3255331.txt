Sorry if this question have already been answered:

Why does DOM have the CDATASection interface. Isn't CDATA Sections
just of interest when you are serializing a document?
(You need to escape certain characters etc)

For instance, does the DOM spec say anything about that you have to return a
node of the 
same type as it was created?. For instance, can I instansiate a Text node
in the tree if the user actually called Document::createCDATASection ?

This also gives a potential problem when you are performing XPath
queries on your document, and it does not comply with the Infoset
specification. (Yes, I know that the specification is quite fresh :-)
