The default-attr behavior should be the same. Good catch.

Deliberately fuzzy in DOM Level 1 and Level 2 because Abstract Schema
support was deferred to DOM Level 3, and hence there really was no portable
DOM API to define, describe, or manipulate default attribute values
established by the DTD or Schema. But even in Level 3, it's possible that
you may have a DOM which does not implement the Abstract Schema APIs, yet
has an internal represtentation of that information and uses it to drive
this behavior; the mechanism in that case would be implementation
dependent.

NOTE THAT DEFAULT ATTRIBUTES ARE A SEPARATE ISSUE FROM VALIDATION. XML
processors are expected to use some information from the
DTD/internal-subset (if one is referenced and available) even when not
validating, and default attr values are in that class.
