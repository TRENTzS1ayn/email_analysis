See recent discussion in this list. If the operation if always illegal with
these two node types, no matter what the values of those nodes are
otherwise, it should probably be reported as a hierarchy error, and most
existing DOMs seem to do it that way simply because it's easiest to code...
but it isn't clear that the DOM has completely nailed this down.
