This is an XML processing question more than a DOM question. In brief, DTDs
do not support namespaces nor vice versa.

DTDs are not namespace-aware. Period. They match on the full qualified
name. If you're using DTDs to set up your default attributes, a default for
attribute foo:bar is applied to all attributes with exactly that name, and
only those attributes, no matter what namespace foo: is bound to.

If you don't like that answer, find a processor that supports the XML
Schema language and rewrite your document type description into that format
rather than using the old DTD syntax. Defaults set in the XML Schema are
applied on a namespace-aware basis, matching the localname and namespace
URI rather than the qname.
