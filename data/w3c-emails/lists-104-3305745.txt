It is a DOMBuilder feature:

"create-cdata-nodes"
true
[required] (default)
 Create CDATASection nodes in response to the
 appearance of CDATA sections in the XML document.
 false
[optional]
 Do not create CDATASection nodes in the DOM document.
 The content of any CDATA sections in the XML document appears in
 the DOM as if it had been normal (non-CDATA) content. If a CDATA
 section is adjacent to other content, the combined content appears
 in a single Text node, i.e. the Text nodes are into "normal" form.
