That argument wouldn't hold water with me.  XHTML is both
HTML and XML ... it makes no sense at all to prohibit using
those added DOM functions (say, in client side JavaScript)
just because the source text is well-formed!

I do recall some conflict in the area of symbol case, where
accomodating legacy script code would seem to demand
mutating the cases of symbols in certain cases that ought to
be easy to nail down.
