I've recently implemented an XPath library that conformed to the
30 August 2001 working draft, and had a question about the changes in the
new version.
I was wondering what was the reason for moving
XPathEvaluator::evaluateExpression() to XPathExpression::evaluate()? It
just seems odd to have two versions of evaluate() in different classes,
when they essentially do the same thing.
To me, this change makes XPathEvaluator::evaluate() redundant, and
changes XPathEvaluator into more of a factory for XPathExpression,
XPathResult, and XPathNSResolver.
Am I missing something? thanks.
