In the DOM level 2 ECMAScript language binding I'm looking at "Object Document".
  While experimenting with the DOM in Netscape 6.1, I must refer to this object 
  as "document" (note difference in case).  Is the DOM implementation in NS 6.1 
  not in compliance with the standard, or am I misunderstanding the ECMAScript 
  language binding?
