Node::normalize can reduce the number of Text nodes present in a document.
What is supposed to happen with these text nodes?

Would a DOM implementation be comformant if it removed all adjacent
Text nodes as with removeChild, and inserted a new Text node with the
combined content in their place?

By the way, what should happen with registered event listeners or DOM
level 3 user data on the original individual text nodes?

Bye, Tobias
