hello, everyone!
I have a question about SystemID of DOCType in Document,
is there any standard style about it?

the following is a DOCType sample, but when I use DocumentBuilder
to parse the XML file, it reports there an error about the DOCType of
the XML file.

<!DOCTYPE ejb-jar PUBLIC "-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Enterprise
JavaBeans 1.1//EN" "http://java.sun.com/j2ee/dtds/ejb-jar_1_1.dtd>

Is there anyone can give me some advices ?

Best regards !
