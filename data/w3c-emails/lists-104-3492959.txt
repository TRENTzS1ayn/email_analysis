As far as what's actually said in the REC goes.. yes, I believe that's
true.

I think there are strong expectations that the "most appropriate"
DOMException  will be chosen.  Generally DOM code shouldn't be throwing
exceptions unless the caller did something wrong, and you want to give them
the clearest information you can so they can fix their code.

Which is most appropriate in every possible case is not  perfectly nailed
down.  The DOM test cases (now under develoment) may help to focus this
more precisely.
