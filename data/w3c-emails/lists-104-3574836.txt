I see your point.  That leads me to my next question (I don't know if this is 
in your sphere of interest).  I am  a web developer, seeking to use the DOM 
with ECMAScript to author scripts that will function in any browser that 
complies with the standards for DOM, ECMAScript, and whatever version of HTML --
 without any monkey business to find out what browser it is or do anything to 
 accomodate any particular browser.  Obviously the most fundamental interface 
 that I will need to access is 'Document' or 'HTMLDocument'.  If different 
 compliant implementations of the DOM can provide access to that interface by 
 objects of different names, how am I supposed to accomplish my goal?
