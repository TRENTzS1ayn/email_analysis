Jesse, you are absolutely right. However, so long as NS and Microsoft state
which object represents Document, then I see this as a faily trivial issue, for
exampe:

getBrowserType();  // some function to determine browser type based on
navigator object

var doc;
if( browser.isNS || browser.isIE ) { doc = window.document; }
if( browser.isNeils ) { doc = neil; }

var node = doc.getElementById( 'myId' ); ......

Cheers, Neil
