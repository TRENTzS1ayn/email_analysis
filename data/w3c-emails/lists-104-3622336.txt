The first line of Neil's example:

>var myDocument = window.document;  // Document object

is outside the scope of the DOM API, and is determined by whatever API
defined the behavior of the window object (and whoever created that object
in turn).

In fact, I think browsers' own ECMAScript APIs are currently fairly
consistant in this regard -- but the DOM per se can't make any promises in
that area.
