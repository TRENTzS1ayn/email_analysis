Which is an utterly prepostrous idea that leads to nothing but errors,
and severe barriers of entry to new browser, who either have to spoof
their user agent string (as Opera does.) or not have support for legacy
content.  Please do not promote this stupid technique and complain to
anyone who does, object detection is the appropriate method, it's more
reliable now and supports future browsers which browser detection
doesn't.

The standard doesn't specify it, however the "standard" that browser
vendors actually work to does specify it.
