Jim. Could you elucidate what you mean by 'object detection'. I am not familiar
with this term. I am all for browser-neutral code, but my my example was merely
to illustrate that that we're not all out of a job and can continue to code, no
matter what the objects are named by a vendor :). And in most cases the vendors
use the same convention.

Cheers, Neil
