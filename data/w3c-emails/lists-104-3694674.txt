The use of standards is to standardize the things the standard covers. If
one standard (the DOM) doesn't cover that part of the browser APIs (it
doesn't), that sounds like a great opportunity to start a project to
establish one that does.

Every API project needs to draw a boundary somewhere and say what it does
and doesn't cover. The DOM is intended to be API for the data model
representing the document; it isn't specific to browsers, so it doesn't
attempt to define browser behavior except within that one box.
