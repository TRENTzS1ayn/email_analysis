Beat the browser authors into coming up with a standard for that next level
of architecture. Or work around it as best you can, and accept that if some
browser comes up with a solution you've never seen before it won't be
supported until you figure out how to recognize and handle it.

I do understand your problem, but it's unavoidable. Saying
"window.document" begs the question of where "window" came from, and so on,
and on, and on... until and unless someone establishes an industry standard
which covers that and gets people to buy into it.

Standardizing the non-DOM portions of DHTML is a fine concept, if someone
has the time/energy/leverage ot pursue it.
