Once again, I see your point.  Is no work being done in this regard?  Window 
control is a very important aspect of client side web scripting.  The DOM only 
solves part of the problem of incompatible scripting environments.  It will be 
essential to have a standard for the window interface provided by the browser, 
which could include, among other things, a standard way of exposing the 
'Document' object of the DOM.  It seems to me this would fall under the W3C's 
sphere of influence, is anyone working on this?
