Not covered in DOM Level 1 or DOM Level 2. Check the documentation for your
preferred parser; most can read from strings, and most of those come with
serializers that can write to strings, but that's application code and is
not yet standardized.

I believe DOM Level 3's Load/Save chapter will address this; check the
working draft for details.
