Hi,

In the definition of ASObject, it seems that "Object" and "Node" are
used
interchangably.  Is this intentionally done?  If yes, please say it
explicitly
in the specification.   If not, it seems to me that the following names
can
be better renamed as:

   asNodetype ===> asObjectType
   nodeName   ===> objectName

and in the description of ASObject, we should mention it as "Object"
instead of "Node"!

Thx,

-Stanley
