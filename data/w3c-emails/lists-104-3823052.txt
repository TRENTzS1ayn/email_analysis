Hi,

How does the "all" schema component defined in XML Schema mapped to
ASContentModel's definition as defined here?  Does Abstract Schema
support
"all" model group at all?

Thx,

-Stanley


Defined Constants
                        AS_ALL
                             All of the above.
                        AS_CHOICE
                             This constant value signifies a choice
operator. For example, in a DTD, this would be
                             the '|' operator.
                        AS_NONE
                             None of the above, i.e., neither a choice
nor sequence operator.
                        AS_SEQUENCE
                             This constant value signifies a sequence
operator. For example, in a DTD, this would
                             be the ',' operator.
