Please visit http://www.w3.org/DOM/Test to read the updated 
documentation for the test suite, as well as instructions on how to 
build the test suite from source.

Note, however, that the DOM TS has not been released; the option to 
build is given in order to facilitate implementors test their 
implementations now as well as invite the community to comment on the 
work done so far.

The DOM TS will be released in the near future, in the meanwhile we 
welcome your comments.
