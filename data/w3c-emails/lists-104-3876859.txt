But at the same time favicon enhances user's browsing expereince.
When you see favicon in bookmark or in location bar, you can understand 
better what is this site about (in case when icon is goog, of course)

As about server logs - you can store data in database (and auto-exclude hits 
for FavIcon) or do not look at server logs at all.
