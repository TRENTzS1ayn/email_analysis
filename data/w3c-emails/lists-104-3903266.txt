Yes - but that takes extra work for something that shouldn't have been
done in the first place. Also, not every server admin will know how or
want to do that. What is so hard about adding a <link rel="shortcut
icon"> to the page? If you want it on all pages then add a server-side
include or auto-insert.

But at the same time favicon enhances user's browsing expereince.
When you see favicon in bookmark or in location bar, you can understand 
better what is this site about (in case when icon is goog, of course)

As about server logs - you can store data in database (and auto-exclude
hits 
for FavIcon) or do not look at server logs at all.
