On behalf of the DOM Working Group [1], I am pleased to announce the
publication of the DOM Level 2 HTML Last Call Working Draft:

http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-DOM-Level-2-HTML-20011207/

The Last Call review period ends on 7 January 2001. Please send review comments
before the review period ends to www-dom@w3.org

------
Abstract:

This specification defines the Document Object Model Level 2 HTML, a platform-
and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically
access and update the content and structure of HTML 4.0 and XHTML 1.0
documents. The Document Object Model Level 2 HTML builds on the Document Object
Model Level 2 Core [DOM Level 2 Core].

The DOM Level 2 HTML is made of a set of specific interfaces to manipulate the
structure and contents of an HTML document.
------

Comments from any Working Group or member of the Community are welcome on
www-dom@w3.org

All comments sent to the mailing list will be recorded at [2] and presented to
the Director before moving to the next stage.

If you sent comments in the past and never received a response (or disagreed

please say so.

No significant changes were made to the document since the previous publication.
