Hi,
 
I have a comment on the CSS document which I am cross posting also to the DOM editors...
 
1. there does not seem to be any way in the specifications to manage multiple windows for MDI type of Web applications.. part of this problem is:
 
a. there is no one specifying that the document object must have things that we have come to rely on in the browser... like the function alert(), open().. or any of the other things that are are there in the Global object of the javascipt environment... I think that these functions, attributes (like screen, location, navigator) should be part of a DOM object somewhere and be standardized...
 
b. because of a. I don't think there is any way to express that this window I am about to open should "always be on top"... the reason I cross posted this is because one could put that in the CSS semantics of z-index... if one could do mulit-window stuff... or as a DOM attribute... 
 
I am not sure which this should go under but I am concerned because I do not see any of this type of info going into CSS Level 3 or 
DOM Level 3 (perhaps I just have not found it yet)...
 
thanks
 
ed roberts
