Ian and Philippe,

Fantastic!

From an authoring tools perspective this is very useful. It allows a
content developer to programmatically exercise the listeners individually
so this has advantages to disabled as well as non-disabled users.

From a disabled user perspective, the input device used to simulate the
activate of each listener may be voice recogntion or some other specialized
input device such as an onscreen keyboard combined with:

   big switch
   specialized keyboard (Don Johnston)

Assistive technologies such as HPR could enumerate the listeners and allow
the user to select which one to activate. This would aid with users
creating web sites as well as accessing them. From a UI perspective a
pop-up window showing the available functions to be executed in response to
each event could be activated allowing the user to hear and speak which one
to be activated ... and then of  couse activate the appropriate one.

If the WCAG group could do more with Script (require addition of function
descriptions) it would be nice to have the ability to store the function
description executed in response to a given event in which case a script
developer could create a function description for those functions executed
in response to an event that could be stored and access through the DOM.
Currently DOM 3 is limited to providing the type definition. ... Perhaps
for DOM 4 we could add this.

Thank you, Philippe. I'll try to gather some use cases.
