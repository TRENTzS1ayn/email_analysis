You're probably right.

That's good to know.

Yes, some clarification is definitely necessary.  And, as discussed in the 
bugzilla thread, there definitely needs to be a mechanism for retrieving the 
specified values as well as the computed or, better yet, actual values.  But, 
the question remains if there would be any value to retrieve in my scenario, 
and I'm not sure if it's a DOM or CSS question.  Being able to retrive actual 
values for certain properties of non-positioned elements -- top, right, 
bottom, left, width, height, etc. -- after they have been laid out according 
to normal flow would be necessary to accomplish a lot of useful things, as 
demonstrated in my example page, but as of now, that capability does not 
_seem_ to be defined, and I notice not incidentally that no one from W3C is 
saying anything.  You do the math.
