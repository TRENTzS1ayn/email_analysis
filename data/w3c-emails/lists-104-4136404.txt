Microsoft (MSDN site) claims that the submit method of a form does not
invoke the onsubmit event handler.

Microsoft goes on to claim on the same page that this method (submit method)
is defined in the W3C DOM Level 1.

The reference I find for the HTMLFormElement in the DOM is section 2.5.5.
Object Definitions.  Here it defines the submit method as performing the
same action as a submit button which implies invoking the onsubmit event.

I cannot find any specific reference here for whether or not the onsubmit
event should or should not be included.

Can you clarify this please because I believe not calling an onsubmit method
if one is defined for a form would be a violation of the W3C L1 DOM?

Thanks.
