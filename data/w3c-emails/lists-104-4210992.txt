I've only been through the first 1/3 of the draft so far.  found two
things though.

1: section 1.6.3, first sentence says
   "... is _a_ HTML 4.0 document ..."
   (my underlining).  it should read "... an HTML 4.0 document ..."
   which is what is used elsewhere in the draft.

2: the definition of HTMLInputElement says that the attribute "size"
   is of type "DOMstring", which startled me.  it didn't take me long
   to find that this is done due to the fact that both HTML 4.01 DTDs
   (strict & transitional) define the "size" attribute as "CDATA" (the
   XHTML DTDs inherit this definition).  the definition contradicts
   the recommendation which itself says:

      ''The width is given in pixels except when type attribute has
        the value "text" or "password". In that case, its value refers
        to the (integer) number of characters.''

   so in both cases the field contains a number.

browser practice differs on this though.  Mozilla 0.9.6 defines the
attribute as a string (element.size.toSource() return 'new String())
while Microsofts reference defines the attribute as an integer.

in my opinion the HTML 4.01 DTD shouldn't allow the attribute to be
set to "foo" when the recommendation clearly notes it should contain a
number, so both the DTDs, the recommendation and in turn the DOM draft
should be updated to reflect this.

(I'm currently not subscribed to the www-html mailing list, feel free
to pass this on to anyone there who might be interested)
