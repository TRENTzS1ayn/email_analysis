Similar to default attribute value, there is a default element content
value.
When a node is cloned, adopted, etc., default attribute value is
discarded.
However, in the current DOM level 3 spec., there is no discussions on
default element content value provided by XML Schema processor.

Should we clarify on how default element content value should behave
when it is cloned, adopted, etc.  Also, should we have a "specified"
flag for it too?

BTW, I am currently not on the mailing list.  Please include my email
address in your response!

Thx,
