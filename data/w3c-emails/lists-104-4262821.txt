What's the reason for keeping asHint and asLocation within
ASModel interface?

Through DOMASBuilder interface, there are two ways of identifying
location information to its parse methods:
   1. URI
   2. DOMInputSource

Taking this location information, parse method in DOMASBuilder
interface can parse and build an ASModel tree.

How does this location information mapped to asHint and asLocation
in ASModel?

The question is do we need them?  If yes, does it provide input source
information or output source information?

Please clarify it!

Thx,

-Stanley
