It claims that:
   This interface extends the Document interface ...
However, in its definition, it doesnot show that
   interface DocumentAS : Document {
     ....
   };

Or, should it really means:
  An instance of DocumentAS interface can be obtained by using
binding-specific
  casting methods on an instance of the Document interface!

Thx,
