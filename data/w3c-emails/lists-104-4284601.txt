I know that Xerces-J has classes like HTMLAnchorElementImpl that would
indicate that at least some effort was made at supporting the HTML DOM, but
I haven't actual tried to exercise that code and I'm pretty sure that they
return false for hasFeature("HTML",null).  If the status seems unclear, you
might ask on the xerces-j-dev list.

I'm definitely interested in identifying any Java-based DOM implementations
on HTML content and Java-based HTML DOM implementations on XML or other
content for the test suite work.
