In HTMLTableElement there are tFoot, tHead and caption.

Why are they *not* readonly?

You can set these elements with the create* methods. Assigning an element
from a different table to one of the three properties would either mean
changing the document's structure (one element cannot be child of two table
nodes, can it?) or copying the contents of one (e.g.) HTMLTableCaption
element into a new one (but the spec doesn't say so).

Should they be readonly (IMHO yes) or is there a certain intent why they are
not?

bye, Thomas
