I think it is clear there needs to be better communication better UA/PF/DOM 
on this issue.  To make the W3C process work we need to focus on making 
sure we all understand the need and possible solutions.  The solutions can 
come from past techniques or from new ideas, but let's use this discussion 
to point out the technical deficiencies or capabilities of proposed 
solutions in meeting the need.  If there were proposed specifications from 
a year ago that are not apart of the current specification, it would be 
more useful to discuss how the current specification differs from the 
proposed specification and/or how the current specification could be modified.
