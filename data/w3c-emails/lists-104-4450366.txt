Arnold,

PF working group requirements are not public. Making them public is really
up to Al Gilman who chairs the working group.

I understand that you are troubled by the current working draft but don't
be since it is only a working draft and the group is going in the correct
direction.

My primary concern is JavaScript. JavaScript is probably the single most
frustrating problem for disabled users today and it is on almost every web
page you go to. The scenario you are talking about is so remote I can't
fathom why you would want to bring it up. I can't remember the last time I
used an SVG viewer on the web much less a .NET applet.

However, long term, there needs to be a mechanism for describing what the
function is that you are trying to do. When I co-architected the Java
Accessibility API with sun we provided a mechanism for listing the
accessible actions of an object in Java. Each action had a description and
a pre-defined action. We extended this to a document to be able to
enumerate the list of links available in a document and their description.
The Self Voicing Kit we developed at IBM allowed us to pop up a dialog box
of the functions and have the user select the one they wanted to execute.
It wran outside the application being spoken but the API provision allowed
us to extract the options and allow the user to activate them.

Specifying exactly how you implement each solution (SVG, .NET applet, Java
applet) requires a great deal of long term work that you are not going to
solve today.

Fair enough. But to be honest, I don't know why anyone would want to
intentionally fire a mutation event and if they did then let them suffer
the consequences.

In most cases this is true.

I am not sure what you mean by hostile. The problem with "disclosing
information" is that content authors seldom disclose information. Just
getting developers to produce alt-text in documents is difficult.

Yes, the DOM is the right place to do this. The WAI User Agents Group as
the central mechanism to gain access to accessibility information. The word
"clues" implies that an assistive technology needs to make a guess. I don't
think that's what you mean. You need to explain more about what you mean by
non-visible elements.

Again, the biggest problem today is JavaScript and not plugins or applets.
Typically these are handled separately. However, it would be nice to know
what you needed to do to activate them.

Could those requirements be made public or could you provide a link?  (I'm
not a W3C member)  I, like Ray, was very troubled by the current working
draft's proposal in that it seemed to have very obvious negatives but
didn't
not seem to be adequate to solve any problems.

So, say you had an SVG drawing embedded in an HTML page that connected
mouse
over in the drawing events with a Java applet and a .NET applet, you'd
expect one accessibility tool to figure out what type of mouse movement you
would need to fake at bring up a specific dialog embedded in one of the
applets.

I am not sure what you mean by hostile. The problem with "disclosing
information" is that content authors seldom disclose information. Just
getting developers to produce alt-text in documents is difficult.

Yes, the DOM is the right place to do this. The WAI User Agents Group as
the central mechanism to gain access to accessibility information. The word
"clues" implies that an assistive technology needs to make a guess. I don't
think that's what you mean. You need to explain more about what you mean by
non-visible elements.

The mutation events contain both the old and new value, spurious mutation
events could have serious side-effects.

For non-script event listeners, the method name is always "handleEvent".

I think everybody that has been involved in this thread is trying to be
helpful.  However, a bad partial solution doesn't help

The key questions that I have are:

a) Is the desire to make it possible for an accessibility tool to make
behavior embedded in hostile web content accessible?  Or is it sufficient
to
enable web content that discloses information that can be used by an
accessibility tool?

b) Is the DOM the right place to do this?  Accessibility tools will still
have to mine the HTML content to find content that implies non-script
actions (like submit buttons).  Would it be reasonable to have content
provide non-visible elements that provide accessibility clues?
