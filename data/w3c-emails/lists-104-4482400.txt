The question is not what happens with a validating parser. That's 
never been at issue. The question is what happens with a 
non-validating parser.

However, this still doesn't tell us what the value of the attribute 
is or what DOM should return for the value of the Attr when the 
actual attribute value contains an unresolved entity reference. DOM 
does not define the value of the attribute in terms of the value of 
its child nodes.

That's definitely not true. DOM does not require validation or a 
validating parser. It works with merely well-formed documents that do 
not have a DTD. It also works with documents that are valid and do 
have DTDs, but which are processed by a non-validating parser.

The problem is that the behavior of a couple of methods in the Node 
and Attr in classes is underspecified in this case.
