It is clear that if you getValue, the returned string will ignore an 
entity reference that has no child text.  If you get the hierarchy of 
the attribute in this case, I think that you really should have an 
EntityReference representing the unexpanded entity reference, but DOM 
does not say that explicitly.  Arguably doing that in an attribute value 
goes beyond what even the infoset describes.

It is clear what DOM will do.  Getting back the value of the attribute 
as a string will not fail, and it will not include anything for any 
empty EntityReference, which may or may not be in the hierarchy, 
depending upon what the parser decided to do.  That is what it always does.

It is only unclear what the parser will do.  Will it put the entity 
reference in the tree, or will it not. Will it abort or will it 
continue.  How is attribute normalization, normally performed by the 
parser, affected by this event.  etc.
