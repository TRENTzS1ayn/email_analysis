Jon,

I agree there is a communication problem. I have a concern that
requirements submitted by the PF 1.5 years ago have not even been read by
some DOM WG members. If there were problems then we could have used the
time to address them.

I think it is clear there needs to be better communication better UA/PF/DOM

on this issue.  To make the W3C process work we need to focus on making
sure we all understand the need and possible solutions.  The solutions can
come from past techniques or from new ideas, but let's use this discussion
to point out the technical deficiencies or capabilities of proposed
solutions in meeting the need.  If there were proposed specifications from
a year ago that are not apart of the current specification, it would be
more useful to discuss how the current specification differs from the
proposed specification and/or how the current specification could be
modified.
