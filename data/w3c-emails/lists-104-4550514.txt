A review of the process is always appropriate.  If I understand Jon's agenda,
it is not necessary to accomplish a review of the history to address what he
wants to discuss, which is to clarify what the user agent wants from the DOM,
in the particular area of the DOM node to event listener relation, in the
context of a scenario showing what the user agent would do for the user.

For those who are members and have the time, the PF contributions to DOM3
requirements are available by starting at the letter of transmittal
archived at
 <<http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/wai-liaison/2000Jun/0000.html>http:/
/lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/wai-liaison/2000Jun/0000.html>.
A cursory review suggests that it is not essential to resolving the narrow
question Jon is trying to focus on.  

On the agenda, as I understand it, here is a draft proposed resolution or
clarification for DOM.  

The user agent wants to know, for each event listener that is listening in the
context of the document, what context it is listening in, and to access this
relation in the inverse relationship:  for each context, what listeners are
there for which that context is the proper context in which the listener is
listening.

All listeners for which [pardon my pseudoCode]
 thisNode.arcRole(listener) = listeningIn; 
 thisNode = listeningIn(listener).

Notes:

+ Bubbling doesn't count.  If a listener with proper context at some ancestor
node in the DOM element tree handles the event after bubbling, it is not
included as associated with a descendant node.

+ All handlers count.  User agent wants to know all events that will be caught
if thrown, not just those natively produced by the devices in use.  

This may lead to throwing inadequately populated event data structures.  The
handler may be asked to do error recovery, the user agent may gain type
knowledge over the event and synthesize it by dialog or otherwise.  Those are
content guidelines and assistive technology issues we probably don't have
critical mass to answer at this point.  But there are feasible strategies, if
the information about "what listeners pertain particularly to this node" were
available.

Compare with the convention in server-side image maps where a (0,0) pointer
value throws you into a pointer-free alternative dialog accessing an
equivalent-facilitation service.

[Please discuss if there are dynamically registered listeners, and how they
fit
into the scenario.]

+ Event names would work, as menu identification of the handlers.  

This is not what we want but if the event names as used in the source code
were
used as menu entries, suitably styled to be clear that they are not friendly
names but pass-throughs of system names, the user would rapily learn what
events this site uses for what kind of stuff and make reasonably effective
choices as to what to do.  If they ever figured out that the context menu was
worth looking at.  But that is our problem on the UA side as to how much to
emphasize this stuff and configuration options that in fact profile how
prominent this information is in the rendered content.

That's my current estimate of what should and can be clarified.  Y'all can
do a
better job collectively, of course.
