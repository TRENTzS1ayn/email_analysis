I asked this a few days ago. OK, you can create new TFOOT, THEAD and CAPTION
elements with document.createElement and assign them to one of the
properties above. But then DOM2-HTML should specify what happens if one
tries to assign a wrong element type ("raises DOMException on setting, if a
wrong element is assigned").

I still think these three properties should be readonly (which would go with
the current documentation of the properties: "_Returns_ the table's
CAPTION..."). Any comments?

bye, Thomas
