The issue has been recorded at [1].

You will receive a reply and have a chance to disagree with it. The next
teleconference for the Working Group is scheduled for the second week of
January and we didn't take the time to address them this week. As long as
the issue is recorded at [1], we will address it as defined in [2] and [3].

Regards,
Philippe
