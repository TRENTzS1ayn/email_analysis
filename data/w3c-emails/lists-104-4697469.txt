I equally enjoy the finer things in life, as in on with the dinner suit and out we go, together with the simpler side, like quiet times at home. I outgrew the club scene years ago but enjoy getting together with friends, barbeques or ??. I am responsible for my 2 beautiful children (aged 11 & 9). Life's pretty good - but I would like to share it with someone special.

<h3>Physical Description</h3>
<p>
I'm 180cm (5'11"), 82kg, Medium / Slim / Athletic, would have dark brown hair, but it's been shaved for many years (not sure how much would actually grow back these days - but I'm sure a lot less than before).
