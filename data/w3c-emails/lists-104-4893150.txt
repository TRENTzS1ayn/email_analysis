"....unnecessary complexity..."
I subscribe to 3 newsgroups; a web developer forum, a web developer dom
forum and this one.  Guess which one the above applies..

".. the problem is in the process.."
If the Queen said black was white what proportion of the population would
disagree?

An observation and a philosophical teaser,
