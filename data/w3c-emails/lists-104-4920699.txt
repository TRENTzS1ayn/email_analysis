I don't need to do anything of the kind. The WG called for comments, and I
provided them. If the DOM WG considers that the ground has already been
covered then it should thank me politely and explain why it has made its
decision.

As it happens, the response to my comments indicates that some members of
the DOM WG were not up-to-date with the current state of XPath 2.0
development, so it seems my comments have indeed provided new information.
But I didn't make my comments because I want to fight any battles, I made
them because the group invited them. Asking for comments and then getting
all defensive when comments are made is just childish.
