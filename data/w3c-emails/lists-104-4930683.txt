Michael,

Thank you for your input. We certainly don't want to scare commenters
who took the time to read and comment the DOM Level 3 XPath draft :-)
Any feedback or input is valuable.

I recorded your issues on our list at [1] and they will be addressed by
the DOM WG. We will take a look at the latest version of the XQuery 1.0
and XPath 2.0 Data Model. The last time we seriously considered
supporting this data model in DOM Level 3 XPath was in June/August 2001.
We had been told not to do so at that time but be reassured that we will
look into the query data model again.

Philippe,
Chair of the DOM WG.
