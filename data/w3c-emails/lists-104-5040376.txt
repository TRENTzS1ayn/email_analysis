I'd be perfectly comfortable leaving that as a quality-of-implementation
issue.

You shouldn't have made the attempt, and for debuggability reasons it's
entirely appropriate for the implementation to tell you so. On the other
hand, the attempt happened to be harmless in this case, so it wouldn't be
inappropriate for it to ignore the request.

So I'd say pick either one and document your choice.
