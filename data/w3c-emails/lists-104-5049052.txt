This was briefly (and unofficially) discussed at the last CSSWG meeting and the 
general feeling of those who discussed it was that the colons should me there. 
So ':before', '::before' and '::selection' would all be valid and would make 
sense, while 'before', 'selection' and ':selection' would be invalid.

This isn't an official answer though. As much work is planned on the CSSOM spec, 
we will hopefully clarify this at some point in the future.
