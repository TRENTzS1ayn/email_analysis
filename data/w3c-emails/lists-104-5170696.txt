In DOM3 there is one place where information can be read on input
but can not be specified for creation of a new document (or component).
This is the internalSubset of the Document Type.
This is unfortunate from the point of view of round trip editing of an
xml document. It is especially unfortunate, given the development of
DOM3 Load and Save.

I recommend that this attribute of documentType be made read/write and
possibly that an internalSubset parameter be added to the
createDocumentType method.

I have never used internalSubset myself (or could care less). However, I
am writing an xml editor which allows users to load/edit/save all
aspects of their documents. The internalSubset is the last major
problem. The others: xml version, encoding, and standalone are being
address by this document.
