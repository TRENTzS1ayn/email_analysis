Hi,

I have a doubt regarding readonly nodes. I believe Entity, EntityReference, 
Notation and DocumentType nodes are readonly. Why does the DOM L1 conformance 
tests then fail, when the setNodeValue() throws a exception for these nodes. The 
tests pass when setNodeValue() is modified not to throw exception!! Why is it 
so? 

Can somebody clarify on this?

Thanks,
Amit
