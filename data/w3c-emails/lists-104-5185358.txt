Sorry, I originally replied to the www-dom-ts list instead.

This was a subject of debate a month or so ago.
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts/2002Mar/0088.html was the
resolution from the work group.

Basically, the WG decided that the explicit statement that setting a
nodeValue has no effect when nodeValue is defined to be null took precedence
over throwing an exception when the node is readonly.
