As of today DOM L1 SE, L2, L3 say:
"The value of this node, depending on its type; see the table above. When it is 
definied to be null, setting it has no effect".

But no one, neither errata says that no effect takes precedence over throwing 
exception.

Is the precedence clause going to be in DOM L1 SE, L2 errata and L3?

Thanks,
Rahul.
