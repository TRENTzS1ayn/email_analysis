Why would you need a mousewheel event? the button attribute could be
used to simulate the wheel, such as in XWindow systems.
btw, the current intent for events is to describe them at the semantic
level instead of the device level. DOMActivate was created with this
idea, ie it is better to react to a DOMActivate than a mouseclick or
keyboard event.
