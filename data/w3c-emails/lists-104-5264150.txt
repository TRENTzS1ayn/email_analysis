Agreed. If there was going to be a standardized event for this it should
probably be the semantic event -- probably a scrolling event, since that's
what the wheel usually maps to -- rather than the low-level one.

The DOM WG isn't defining every possible device event, or even every
possible semantic event. A lot of that will wind up being someone else's
responsibilities. Note that the DOM doesn't _have_ to define them all,
since the DOM event system will happily propigate events other than those
defined in this spec.
