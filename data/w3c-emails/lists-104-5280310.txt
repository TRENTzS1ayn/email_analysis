There are good reasons for preferring a mousewheel event, in addition to a
button event

The fact is they are different, riding a bike and turning the lights off are
very different types of action.
In the future one can easily imagine that timing will be critical, much as
it is with games today.
It is important that the distinction is made so that everyone in the design
cycle considers the uses to which these distinct inputs may be put.

Which is not to suggest, that users who have an impediment to using one or
the other should be disadvantaged, quite the reverse.
So that we can design systems that enable button users to travers hundreds
of clicks swiftly, and wheel users to migrate slowly.

Unless programmers are aware of this presently, we cannot expect them to
create good interfaces.

thanks

I'm a teacher of people with severe learning difficulties.
an example of wheel use for navigation is here:

it would be quite innapropriate to suggest users navigate this with a
button, unfortunately it isn't possible either.
