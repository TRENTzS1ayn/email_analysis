Fine, but that's out of scope of the DOM... except that the very fact that
there isn't consensus about what mousewheels should do, or even on whether
mousewheels are going to persist or are just a fad, suggests that
standardizing a hardware-specific event to represent them would be
premature at best, and probably inappropriate.
