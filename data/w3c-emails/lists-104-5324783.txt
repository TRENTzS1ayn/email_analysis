I disagree.

Users need to capture mouse wheel events and implementors are also starting
adding that in their DOM implementation. If the DOM WG does not provide the
concrete event type and the appropriate event definition, there is no chance
for interoperability here.

I really think the DOM WG should define a MouseWheelEvent as they had
defined the MouseEvent type (which *is* by the way a low-level event type).
