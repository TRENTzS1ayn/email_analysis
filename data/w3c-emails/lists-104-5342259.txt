I know that and I am working with the WAI WG on that issue for SVG. Trying
to not remove the MouseEvent types from SVG1.1 :)

Don't you think that if the DOM WG does not add this event, it will have to
deal with this issue one day or another because browsers will provide the
'mousewheel' event and then will need interoperability.
