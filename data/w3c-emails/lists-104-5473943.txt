Just my 2 cents worth as an observer to a debate that happens to be public.

Microsoft is obviously trying to leverage its advantage.  (Not that there's anything wrong with that.)  Some people think this advantage is real - some don't.  It's hard to tell who is being honest and who has the hidden agenda of just trying to support one side or the other.

I think individuals have a right to an agenda, hidden or not.  But, doesn't the WG have an obligation to be impartial?

The longer this debate goes on, the less I believe the technical arguments of the WG and the more I think they're not being impartial.

Someone may have to deal, if mousewheels last longer than mice with
Trackpoints... and if mice themselves survive rather than being replaced
with other pointing devices.

Probably not with mousewheel, since what will happen is that people will
bind mousewheel at a low level to something meaningful, and use the latter
in their apps. More accessibility for users who don't happen to have or be
able to operate a wheel, and more flexibility for those who want to use the
wheel for something else. Hardwired user interfaces are NOT the wave of the
future, in my opinion.

And probably not the DOM, since the DOM is primarily a Document API rather
than a Browser API. We provided a "starter kit" of events. I don't think we
want to get into the business of defining all the events for everyone. If
HTML defines a mousewheel event despite the preceeding paragraph,, the DOM
can support it. That's as much as the DOM needs to do, and probably as much
as the DOM should do.
