Hi,

Thanks for all the clarification. Some of my questions, I asked below, are still unanswered. I would 
squeeze them into three small questions:
1. Should setNodeValue() for Notation throw an exception per L1 REC or L1 WD SE should be referred?
2. Should setNodeValue() for Notation, Entity and EntityReference throw an exception per L1 WD SE?.
3. What is the resolution for this? - Errata or leave it as it is.

Thanks,
Rahul.
