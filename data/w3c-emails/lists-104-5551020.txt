Hi,

According to the DOM Level3 Events module, the 'createEvent' method on
the 'DocumentEvent' interface does not take a namespaceURI. I am
curious to know whether or not the DOM WG has not found any issue with
that.

I mean that users can initialize an event with a namespaceURI and an
eventType, but an implementation does not need to know the
namespaceURI to create the object?

BTW: In the 'createEvent' method of the 'DocumentEvent' interface, the
wording used to describe the interfaceType parameter should mention
'initUIEventNS' rather than 'initUIEvent'.

Thierry.
