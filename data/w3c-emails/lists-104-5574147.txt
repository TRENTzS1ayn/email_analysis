This is probably a Xalan problem rather than a DOM problem. Xalan has its
own support mailing lists at http://xml.apache.org; asking there is more
likely to get a useful answer.

However, in this case the answer's fairly obvious: XSLT is namespace-aware.
You've created a non-namespace-aware DOM. Replace your calls to
createElement with createElementNS, using the proper namespace URIs.
