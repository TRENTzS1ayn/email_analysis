Don't confuse an individual's point of view expressed in discussion with
the DOM WG's point of view, especially as I'm no longer a WG member.

As far as I know,  my agenda is not a hidden one:  "Don't multiply
interfaces without clear need; don't create overly specific interfaces
where general ones will do." I'd object to Trackpoint-specific events just
as much as I'd object to mousewheel-specific events.
