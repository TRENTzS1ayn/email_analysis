I have a question regarding the draft for the DOM3 Events Spec:

If preventDefault is called on the keydown event, does this also cancel 
the following textInput event?


Example:
The key A is pressed in a text input field. preventDefault is called on 
the keydown event.  Is A displayed in the text field?  Is the textInput 
event fired?


What if preventDefault is called on the mousedown event. Is the click 
event fired?


These questions are inspired by 
<http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=139421>.


Thanks,

Christian
