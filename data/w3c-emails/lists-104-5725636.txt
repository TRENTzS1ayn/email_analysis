Elena Litani in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom-ts/2002Apr/0088.html, observed
that several tests in the DOM L1 test suite that use createEntityReference()
would fail if the test document was loaded with the "entities" normalization
feature set to false.

On reviewing the normalization features, there does not seem to be the
equivalent of JAXP's
javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory.setExpandEntityReferences(true) or
Xerces-C's default behavior.  That is a mode that would expand entity
references, but preserve entity nodes.

I don't see a strong use case for eliminating unreferenced entity nodes and
there does not seem to be a parallel normalization to eliminate unreferenced
notation declarations or unreferenced element definitions in ASLS.  Even if
there were, I would then suggest that there should still be an equivalent of
the currently deployed behavior.
