What do I need to be able to programmatically create XML that allows me to
write the <!DOCTYPE tag?
I am using createProcessingInstruction to write the <? xml version="1.0" ?>.

I have read that both the above and <!Doctype are not available with DOM
LEVEL 1, but obviously I have accomplished one of the two.

What do I need to accomplish the writing of the <!Doctype programmatically
using C++ (Microsoft Visual Studio 6 sp4) ?

I am moving MSXML 3.0.  I hoping it has the W3C DOM LEVEL compliance
necessary for this ability.
