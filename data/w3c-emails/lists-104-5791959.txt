DOM Level 2 added fields to DocumentType which can describe the <!DOCTYPE>.
These are set at the time the DocumentType node is created -- which, in
DOM2, must be before the Document node is created, since some enhanced DOMs
might want to use the DocumentType information to help guide selection of
specific DOM implementation classes.

A modern DOM serializer should recognize those fields and produce the
correct output.

DOM3 was considering allowing later binding of the DocumentType node to the
Document; I'm not sure what the current status of that proposal is.
