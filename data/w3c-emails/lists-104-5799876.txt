I am trying to write a <!DOCTYPE to XML I am building.

All the methods are read-only.

I see that IXMLDOMImplementation has a GetTypeInfo call.

I am using MSXML and trying to find a non-.NET MSXML SDK that supports
IXMLDOMImplementation's CreateDocumentType.
Do I need that or is there another way around writing <!DOCTYPE to my XML?

Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML) 4.0 - DOM Developer's Guide states 
"Working with the Document Type

The document type node represents the information provided by the DOCTYPE
declaration, if one appears. The IXMLDOMDocumentType object, accessible
through the doctype property of the DOMDocument object, is read-only. This
object provides access to the entities and notations that have been declared
in the document type definition (DTD) of the document. Its name property
identifies the root element of the document.
For more information about properties and methods of IXMLDOMDocumentType,
see the IXMLDOMDocumentType <xml_obj_ixmldomdocumenttype_619h.htm>."
