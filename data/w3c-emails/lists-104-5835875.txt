3 errata for DOM Level 2 Core have been published.

[1] Node.nodeValue
    The sentence

    When it is defined to be null, setting it has no effect.

    should read:

    When it is defined to be null, setting it has no effect, including
if the node is read-only.

[2] DocumentType
    The following paragraph should be added in the description:

    DocumentType nodes are read-only.

[3]  XML Namespaces
    The description

    Note that because the DOM does no lexical checking, the empty string
will be treated as a real namespace URI in DOM Level 2 methods.
Applications must use the value null as the namespaceURI parameter for
methods if they wish to have no namespace.

    should read

    Note that because some progamming languages cannot differenciate
null from an empty string, and because an empty string is not a valid
namespace URI, even though the DOM does no lexical checking, the way an
empty string is treated, when given as a namespace URI to a DOM Level 2
method, is implementation dependent. Applications must use the value
null as the namespaceURI parameter for methods if they wish to have no
namespace.
