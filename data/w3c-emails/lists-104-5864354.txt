The motivation for initMutationEvent is to enable DOM users to dispatch
their own events that can be adequately represented using the MutationEvent
interface.  There should not be any requirement that an events generated by
a DOM implementation (like the standard mutation events) use
initMutationEvent to prepare their events for dispatching.  The requirements
placed on the standard mutation events fired by the dom implementation and
the requirements on the parameters are orthogonal.

For example, a dom user could use initMutationEvent to prepare a
MutationEvent of type "ExampleCorp.PriceMarkdown".  That event might be
defined so that prevValue is required to be provided, but initMutationEvent
cannot enforce it since it has no knowledge of that event type.
