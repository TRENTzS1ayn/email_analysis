The requirements are what I am asking about. In the DOMCharacterDataModified variant,
is an implementation required to provide a non-NULL prevValue in order to claim compliance?

As far as the requirements being orthogonal among standard events and custom events, that is
not specified. There is no Event Exception specified when - for example - the bubbles or cancelable
parameters of an "init" method differ from any previously specified behavior. Or in the case of
a MutationEvent, when a script dispatches a DOMCharacterDataModified event with a NULL prevValue
event though prevValue is documented to be available.
