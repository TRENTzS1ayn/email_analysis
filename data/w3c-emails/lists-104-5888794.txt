All of these issues revolve around clarifying how and when to handle null as
an allowed/expected value, particularly for empty nodesets.  I can guess at
what's intended with pretty high confidence, but the point of a spec is that
I shouldn't have to guess.

Issue: empty nodeset vs. snapshot types

If a snapshot result type is requested, how is an empty nodeset
represented?  As snapshotLength being 0? As snapshotItem(0) returning null?
Both?

Issue: snapshotItem() of invalid index

The spec says that an invalid index returns null, yet an index value that is
greater than the snapshotLength is always a usage error. Consider throwing
an exception for the usage error cases.

Issue: empty nodeset vs. iteration types

If an interation type is requested, how is an empty nodeset represented? By
iterateNext() returning null on the first call?

Issue: Can XPathResult stringValue ever be null?

None of the functions that return strings in the XPath spec can return null.
Nevertheless, the DOM 3 XPath spec should make it clear whether stringValue
may ever be null, particularly for those of us who plan to include
extensions to the function suite.
