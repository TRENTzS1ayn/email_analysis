I'm back on Level 3 Load/Save for DOM-Lingo, and I have a quick question
(based on the 09 Apr 2002 Draft):

DocumentLS.saveXML isn't clear enough as to whether it's deep or not. If the
snode parameter is null, the whole document is serialized. OK, that's deep.
But if it is non-null, then ONLY the Node provided is serialized? I think it
might be nice to have a boolean deep argument for this method, and specify
that the provided Node, and all its children, may be serialized if the deep
parameter is true.
