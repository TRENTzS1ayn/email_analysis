I'm posting this again, because our IT guys said there may have been
problems with our Exchange server, and it may have not gone out.

I'd really like to get some feedcback from someone on the list regarding
this.

I'm back on Level 3 Load/Save for DOM-Lingo, and I have a quick question
(based on the 09 Apr 2002 Draft):

DocumentLS.saveXML isn't clear enough as to whether it's deep or not. If the
snode parameter is null, the whole document is serialized. OK, that's deep.
But if it is non-null, then ONLY the Node provided is serialized? What if
one wishes to use DocumentLS.saveXML to serialize a specific node AND its
children? I think it might be nice to have a boolean deep argument for this
method, and specify that the provided Node, and all its children, may be
serialized if the deep parameter is true. If false, then only the provided
Node is serialized.

And also, regarding the utility of the WWW-DOM list: how are posts such as
these handled by the WG? Are they entered as Issues to be resolved as part
of the current Draft cycle? Or are they simply reviewed and resonded to in
real time, if a response is deemed appropriate?
