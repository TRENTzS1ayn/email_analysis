Thanks for the response,

As far as I can remember this is meant to be deep all the time.
Let me check it with the next telco of the editorial team to see whether
we need to change the description of saveXML.I don't see any use case for a non-deep serialization of a node.

The dom wg responses to postings to www-dom either explicit or implicit,
that's where the public mailing list is meant for. It make take a while
before issues are discussed.
