That's correct.  "style" is a property on the ElementCSSInlineStyle
interface [1].  As the prose there says:  "The expectation is that an
instance of the ElementCSSInlineStyle interface can be obtained by using
binding-specific casting methods on an instance of the Element interface
when the element supports inline CSS style informations."  So
HTMLTableElement instances that support inline CSS can be cast to
ElementCSSInlineStyle somehow (in the typical browser's ECMA binding you
just reference the "style" property and the casting is done automatically).
