Since DOM2 defines the DOMActivate UI event as well as the click MouseEvent, should both events be fired? A related situation is with DOM methods that cause invocation of event handlers, such as calling button.click() on an INPUT element. Should that cause click MouseEvent listeners to be called?

For example, a script calling the "click" method of a HTMLButton would NOT result in an event being dispatched to eventListeners registered for MouseEvent events. It could, however, cause the "DOMActivate" event to get called (depending on whether DOMActivate invokes the action or just serves as a means to intercept and prevent the default action. See <http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom/2002AprJun/0026.html>)

Hitting enter on a focused element would trigger both the DOMActivate
and Click event.
