Issues handling depends on the module.

Events and LS include them in the draft itself and therefore all issues
are resolved as part of the current draft cycle.

Core include some of the issues in the draft itself, others are part of
the agenda of the teleconference.

We don't necessarily respond to the messages on the mailing lists
(public or not). Core, LS, and Events are still working drafts (ie not
in Last Call) and therefore we don't track them officially. This
explains why we may forgot some of them sometimes even if we try not to.
So it is always good to repost your issues if you didn't anything
happening in a new draft.

XPath has now an official list of issues since it is in Last Call.
Issues are recorded at [1] and will receive a response. You can see that
some of them have already been considered and decided (or declined) by
the WG but the person who raised the issue didn't receive a response. We
are still willing to consider issues for the draft even if the deadline
is over but don't guarantee official response in that case (but will try
to).

HTML has also an official list but the list is now closed. We don't
accept anymore issues on the draft until further notice. You can expect
an update of this draft "soon".

As an example, your issue regarding DocumentLS.saveXML was raised
yesterday during an editor teleconference for Load and Save, the draft
was modified to include "DocumentLS.saveXML saves the document or the
given node and all its decendants to a string.", the issue was recorded
under "LS-Issue-105", and closed.

The delay between the message and the response may vary, depending on
the editors, our priorities, and their meetings. DOM Level 1 Second
Edition for example has a low priority on our agenda but is still part
of it.
