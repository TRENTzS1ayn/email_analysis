AS far as I read the draft, the parameter represents the type of Event
interface ("UIEvent") to be created, not the type event itself. However,
more reading leads to think that the parameter is in fact the feature
name of the Event interface ("UIEvents"). There is clearly something to
fix here.

background:
XML Events introduced namespaces for event types, ie the type of an
event is {"http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events", "DOMActivate"} instead of
"DOMActivate". There is currently a proposal to include this mechanism
in DOM Level 3 Events however it is not clear if it is going to remain
in XML Events, this explains why the draft is currently on hold.

The user creates an object of type UIEvent:
DocumentEvent.createEvent("UIEvents") and then initialize with the
appropriate parameters ("http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events",
"DOMActivate", ...)

initUIEvent is given as an example but I agree that the example should
better recommend the use of initUIEventNS than initUIEvent.
