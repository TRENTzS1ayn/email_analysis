Opera's "pretend to be IE" mode actually does very little to its
implementation of the DOM; it merely adds the non-standard
document.all property.

Opera does not support document.implementation. Neither does IE5
for Windows. IE6 and Mozilla do, however. If you want to call hasFeature
you should check for the existence of document.implementation first.

You can access *some* properties (eg style.top on positioned elements),
but because Opera (as of the current version) does not have anything
like a full DOM Level 1 implementation you are extremely limited in
what you can do. For details of what Opera implements, see:

  http://www.opera.com/docs/specs/js/

If you aim is to play with browser DOM in general, try Mozilla. If you
want to make sure things work in IE, you really need to install IE. For
details of the DOM used by IE (including all the non-standard extensions)
see:
