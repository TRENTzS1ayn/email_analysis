Alternatively, you could have HTMLFormControl as a distinct interface
implemented by form controls and not inserted in the inheritance hierarchy
of HTML[Select|Input|...]Element.  If introduced later, you would want to do
it that way to avoid introducing another breaking change to the Java
interfaces.
