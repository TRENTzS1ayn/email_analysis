This is similar to the color tests described earlier in the day.  

There is no specific instruction in 
http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-HTML/html.html#ID-26019118 that 
addresses the allowable changes to the case of attribute values (though 
element and attribute tag names are explicitly addressed).  I think it 
would be good to extend a case-insensitive comparision cause to include 
any attribute value designated as case-insensitive in the HTML 
recommendation.  Otherwise, we are just bending the tests to meet the 
deployed implementations.
