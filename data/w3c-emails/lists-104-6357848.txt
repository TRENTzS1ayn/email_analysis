http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-DOM-Level-2-Style-20001113/css.html#CSS-CSSStyleDeclaration-setProperty
actually lists the only current useful value of the priority:
"important".  Using setProperty("foo", "bar", "important") is equivalent
to having the declaration:

foo: bar !important;

in your declaration block in CSS.
