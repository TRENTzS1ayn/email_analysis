Hello,

I looked over your Last Call Working Draft [1] and find no faults. It
is beautifully done! Here are a few comments.

In the status section, W3C members -> W3C Members
In Appendix E, ECMA Script -> ECMAScript
In References, you could list editors for W3C publications.
In spec.css, the selectors h4, ul, ol, li, and div could be lowercase 
for XHTML.
In spec.css, class .ecma-block could use padding: .5em or so.
Also in spec.css, #005A9C (in place of #0050B2) for h4 would match h1-h3 in
W3C's technical reports style sheets.
