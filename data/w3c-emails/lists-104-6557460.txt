I agree that this is the best approach. Its an example where loose
language seemed ok because there was only one coordinate system. But,
given we have multiple ones, its a pain and this clarification (not
really a change) would be the best solution.

Yes but we already know that there are problems when moving over a
rendering context boundary.  How would you propose making both sets of
information available 9I guess the missing set would be relative to
the root element coordinate system, or would that be any named
elements coordinate system?

That seems like a backwards step. It breaks lots of stuff while not
really helping non-SVG DOM usage any. And the first proposal did not
break non-SVG Dom usage. So I prefer the first solution.
