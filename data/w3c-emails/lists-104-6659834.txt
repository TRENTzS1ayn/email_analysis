Precisely.  And the proposed property is backwards-compatible itself.

For the record, IE/Mac's DOM implementation is not a port of IE/Windows' DOM
implementation.  IE/Mac's DOM implementation is provided by the Tasman
presentation engine which is an independent codebase from IE/Windows, and
which was written by a separate team (in a different state for that matter).

With IE5/Mac we went to great effort to ensure compatibility with
IE5/Windows DOM (with the exception of a few minor areas such as Text Ranges
and ActiveX).

True, multiple vendor support implies greater political acceptance.

However, two separate teams (whether the same vendor or not) doing
independent implementations should have equivalent weight on a technical
basis.
