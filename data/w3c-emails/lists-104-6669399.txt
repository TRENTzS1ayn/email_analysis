To:www-dom@w3.org

is there some built in method in dom
for sorting?

Specifically, what I want to do is sort
an html table. The table itself, as well
as each row and cell has an id. I want
to be able to sort the rows, based on
a particular column.

I was wondering if dom provided for such
a thing, so I wouldn't have to write a
function to do the sorting myself.

Thanks!
