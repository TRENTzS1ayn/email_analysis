>is there some built in method in dom for sorting?

No. (You could answer this for yourself quite quickly by glancing through
the DOM spec, you know...)

Simplest solution may be to feed your document through an XSLT stylesheet
which performs the sort you want, then parse that. Some XSLT processors can
produce a DOM-compatable data model as their output, which would save you
the trouble of serializing and re-parsing, though that may be a read-only
subset of the DOM and hence may have to be imported into another
implementation before you can edit it further.
