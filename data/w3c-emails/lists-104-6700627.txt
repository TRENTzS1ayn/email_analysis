In the abstract model object model section 18 is the following:

 "XML defined the "well-formed" (WF) state for documents which are parsed without reference to their DTDs. "

This is not worded well, because WF documents still MUST include internal entities and MAY include external entities (see XML 4.4,3).  However XML says at 2.1 

"[Definition: A textual object is a well-formed XML document if:]
  1.. Taken as a whole, it matches the production labeled document.

  2.. It meets all the well-formedness constraints given in this specification.

  3.. Each of the parsed entities which is referenced directly or indirectly within the document is well-formed."

So even a WF document is parsed with reference to (the entity declarations in) the DTD.

I think it is worthwhile avoiding this mistake, because already so many XML system get entities wrong.
