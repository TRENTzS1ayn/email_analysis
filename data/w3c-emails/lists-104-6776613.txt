The parse would be non-validating, whether an attempt
was made or not.  The problem was ... what?

The "org.xml.sax.ext.EntityResolver2" interface (see the SAX website,
http://www.saxproject.org, for such draft "extensions 1.1" APIs) makes
that information available to the resolver.  Not that it can cause PEs
to be "skipped"; it can only resolve them to empty content, which is a
much simpler thing.

Having thought about this a bit, I can still say that I think it's a lot more
usable to just have controls that affect all external entitiees of a given
type:  PE or GE.  Attempting more granular control, particularly of PEs,
creates needless confusion and potential for error.
