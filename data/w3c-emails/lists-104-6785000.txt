I have to say I find the whole abstract schemas approach to be 
woefully lacking in basic functionality. There really should be some 
sort of getType() method on Element, Attr, and perhaps Node that 
returns some representation of the DTD type and possibly the schema 
type. Details could be worked out (Two separate methods for DTD and 
schema types or just one? Which interfaces to put this on? How are 
types represented? etc.) but first there'd need to be a recognition 
from the DOM group that this is an important requirement that AS as 
currently designed simply does not solve.
