Somebody Answer this...

   I want to parse an XML from a String. i.e., i have an XML obtained in the form of a String and i want to parse it. How can i do that, as the DocumentBuilder class has methods to parse from a File, InputStream, InputSourse, etc, but not with a String. Please help me...

Ravi.
