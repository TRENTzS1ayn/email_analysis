I checked with Netscape 3.0, 4.7, 6.x and with IE5.5, neither of which 
fire the onsubmit event when the submit method is called on a form.

No versions of Netscape prior to 6.0 supported the input.size property, 
so it seems like this should be changed to a number (it's a string in 
Netscape 6.0+, but we can change that in the next release).

Both select.length and select.options.length (select === select.options 
in versions earlier than 6.0 of Netscape) have been read-write in 
Netscape sinze 3.0.
