This would be significantly incompatible with existing scripts, the
submit method is very commonly used in scripts so as to circumvent the
onsubmit event.  Existing scripts will break, making many forms
unsubmittable.  While backwards compatibility isn't essential, there
needs to be very, very good reasons not to be - this doesn't appear to
have any good reason.
