a simple question from a beginner:
when nodevalue=null?


I was doing some tests to see the nodes property behavior.
in vbscript I wrote:
      resp = ("&nbspvalue:&nbsp" & x.nodevalue & "&nbspnname:&nbsp" &
x.nodename)

and this is the browser answer:
value:??name:?director

So, if a node has childnodes, is its value not null?
