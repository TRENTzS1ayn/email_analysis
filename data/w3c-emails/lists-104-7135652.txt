The interface definitions in the SVG 1.0 spec appear to be defined using an IDL syntax in the prose of the document.  It would be helpful from both a DOM testing and code generation perspective (as well as a documentation consistency with other DOM related technologies), if the ultimate definitions for the SVG DOM in SVG 1.1 were expressed and available in the XML representation used in the DOM specs.

The only thing that looks like it might be an issue is the use of multiple inheritance in the interface definitions, it is possible that the current DOM stylesheets might not support that, but it should be relatively easy to change those to support a space separated list of base interface names.
