Since the functionality under "Validation and Other Interfaces" is
common to both AS-editing and document-editing, a retrieval of either
"AS-EDIT" or "AS-DOC" could be interpreted as having support of
these features.  However, if document-editing is to
be completely independent of AS-editing, then perhaps another
feature string should be made for functionality under this section.
We will discuss in our AS ET telcon.
