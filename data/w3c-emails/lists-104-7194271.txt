Steven, in order to finish addressing the issues from the HTML
WG, we would like a clarification:

should it read

or

is only relevant in form controls, therefore

According to section 4.10 in http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#diffs ,
it doesn't seem that the attribute name is deprecated in forms control
too.

Otherwise, we are almost done with other issues. As an heads-up, you can
look at 
http://www.w3.org/2001/12/DOM-Level-2-issues
(I of course expect to send a complete to the HTML WG in any case)
