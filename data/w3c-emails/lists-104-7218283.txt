In the DOMWriter section of the January 14 Load and Save draft the 
following paragraph is out of sync with what follows:

While serializing a document the serializer will write out non-specified 
values (such as attributes whose |specified| is |false| ) if the 
|output-default-values| feature is set to |true| . If the 
|output-default-values| flag is set to |false| and the 
|use-abstract-schema| feature is set to |true| the abstract schema will 
be used to determine if a value is specified or not, if 
|use-abstract-schema| is not set the |specified| flag on attribute nodes 
is used to determine if attribute values should be written out.

Two problems here:

1. The output-default-values feature is now the discard-default-content 
feature so this should read, "...if the discard-default-content feature 
is set to |false|. If the discard-default-content flag is set to true..."

2. The |||use-abstract-schema| feature is not described in the list of 
features for the DOMWriter given subsequently
