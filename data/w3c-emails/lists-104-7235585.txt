One of the open issues in the DOM L2 test suite is the
interpretation of "*" as a namespace argument to
getElementsByTagNameNS().

Most implementations interpret '*' to match all
elements with the specified local name regardless if
they are namespace qualified or not.  GNUJAXP has
interpreted "matches all namespaces" as meaning that
getElementsByTagName("*","whatever") should not match
elements that are not namespace qualified.

It would be good to resolve the issue (assuming to
favor the much more common interpretation of matching
both qualified and unqualified elements) and clarify
the text in the DOM L3 text instead of issuing a
errata after DOM L3.
