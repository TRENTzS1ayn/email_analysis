Which IMO is clearly nonconforming behavior on the
part of any such implementations.

That is, the issue is:  Does the text in the spec that 'The
special value "*" matches all namespaces" mean what
it says?

It's completely clear from the namespace spec that
there do exist names which are not in a namespace.
For example, the element in the document "<foo/>"
is in no namespace.

IMO what Curt's proposing is to bless an implementation
bug by changing the behavior of the specification.  While
W3C can of course do that, I'd not encourage it.
