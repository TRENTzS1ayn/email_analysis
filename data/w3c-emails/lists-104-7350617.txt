If you use non-namespace-aware calls to retrieve the attribute by name, and
there are several attributes which have that name (due to having been
created using the namespace-aware calls) -- a DOM may return _any_ of them.
It is hoped that it will consistantly return the same one given the same
source document, but that's about the best you can hope for.

Simple advice: Don't use the non-namespace-aware calls. They're provided
only for backward compatability with existing DOM Level 1 code, and can not
really be safely intermixed with the namespace-aware Level 2 methods. Treat
the old calls as deprecated.
