* removed eventListenerList.
* added isRegisteredHere and canTrigger.
* added CustomEvent interface
* Event.type returns event names in lowercase.
  (this should be an erratum for DOM Level 2 Events)
* the description of event flow was clarified.
  (but it seems that we need to clarify the default action behavior).

so please check the issues list:

The issue regarding "Integration and access to semantics" is still on
going with the WAI WGs and XML Events.

I would like to highlight the issue naming-1 on Event.type:
