* removed XPathSetIterator, XPathSetSnapshot.
* XPathResult: lots of changes to integrate the iterators and snapshots.
* bunchs of issues were added and closed.


one open issue:

Issue XPath-25:
    Should there be a reset method on the result in case someone wants
to iterate the result multiple times? It may be more trouble than it is
worth, because the user can request a new query. See if there are use
cases.
