The description of serializing character data and attributes is at variance with XML C14N rules; it seems preferable to stay consistent with C14N where possible, or at least to better motivate any departures.
 
For example, the description:
 
"Attributes containing quotes but no apostrophes are serialized in apostrophes (single quotes). Attributes containing both forms of quotes are serialized in quotes, with quotes within the value represented by the predefined entity &quot;."
 
varies from C14N which never uses single quotes but always replaces a quotation mark in the attribute value with &quot;.
 
Somebody should carefully review this text with respect to C14N rules, and either use C14N rules or provide feature options on DOMWriter that allows the user of DOMWriter to choose the appropriate serialization.
