Should the ECMAScript bindings bind the XPathNSResolver interface to a
function rather then an Object. The NodeFilter interface which looks very
similar to the XPathNSResolver interface (no attributes and only one
function) contains a similar binding.

This would make it easier for ECMAScript applications to implement own
customized XPathNSResolver implementations.
