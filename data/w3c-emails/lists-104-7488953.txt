Assuming "rame2" was a typo...

If you're running your script in frame1; I'd not expect gEBI to return the
id of the other frame, as it's not in the document(!); Instead, it's in the
parent document.

My first choice would be to use the window.frames collection (although I
forget how cross browser safe it is) or even using
window.document.getElementById() (Theory goes that by qualifying *which*
document object you want to play with, will work.)
