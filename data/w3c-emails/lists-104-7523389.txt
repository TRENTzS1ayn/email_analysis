When attached to an attribute, e.g.


interface Document : Node {
   // Modified in DOM Level 3:
   readonly attribute DocumentType    doctype;

this means that the specified attribute will have a getter method but 
not a setter method. It does not mean that the internal 
characteristics of that object will not change. In this example this 
means that you cannot change a Document object's doctype to point it 
at a different object. However, you might be able to use methods in 
the DocuemntType class to change the properties of the doctype object 
if they're not also declared to be read-only. (Actually in this case, 
I think they are, so that's a bad example.)
