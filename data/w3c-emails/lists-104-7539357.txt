In November 2000, DOM Level 2 HTML was delayed for backward
compatibility reasons and our intent is to capture the current practice
in several implementation, which is not the case for indeterminate. Only
IE implementations are supporting this indeterminate feature for the
moment. The TriState implementation [1] does support indeterminate
property but it is not equivalent to the one in IEs. So, even if other
implementation are going to implement indeterminate in the future, we
prefer not to add this new feature for the moment. This certainly needs
to be on the list for an XForms API at some point.

Please, let us know if you are (or are not) satisfy with this decision,

Philippe,
for the DOM WG.
