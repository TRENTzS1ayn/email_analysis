The interface HTMLOptionsCollection was added in the draft. It is
equivalent to an HTMLCollection except that its length attribute is
read-write.

HTMLSelectElement.options is now of type HTMLOptionsCollection.
(this makes select.options.length read-write).

For consistency, HTMLSelectElement.length is now read-write.

It is allowed for implementation to not support these read-write
functionalities on those attributes. In such case, an exception
"NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR" will occur.

Regarding array manipulation in ECMAScript, this is language dependent
and cannot be part of the DOM Level 2 HTML specification. In any case,
we recommend using the manipulation methods provided by the DOM Level 2
Core (removeNode, appendChild, ...) to manipulate the children of the
select element.

Please, let us know if you are (or are not) satisfy with this decision,

Philippe,
for the DOM WG.

It is extremely common to clear a select of all options by setting the length to zero. Pages do this to clear a select and then repopulate it with new options. Pages also commonly modify options in the ways listed above.
