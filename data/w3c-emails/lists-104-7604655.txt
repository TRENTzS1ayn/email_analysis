I am not sure to what you are referring to as *differences between
implementations*.  In any case I am not satisfied.

Any means which permits the client to circumvent conditions placed upon the
form submit method invalidates the purpose of having an onsubmit method
(particullarly in light of the fact that it is used in 99% of cases as a
validation tool). To my mind this is (permits) a grave abuse of an implied
contract and the onsubmit method should be removed from the FORM object.  At
the very least it should be boldly stated in any and all documentation that
the onsubmit event IS NOT GUARANTEED to be called by the submit method.

Thank you for your consideration.
