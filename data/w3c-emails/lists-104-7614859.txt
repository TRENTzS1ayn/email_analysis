Is the URI of the document within the frame at least readable by the
surrounding frames or main document?

For security reasons, it is important not to let the user access the URI
of the other document. src is not dynamically updated and we don't plan
to add a new attribute for that effect.

Please, let us know if you are (or are not) satisfy with this decision,

Philippe,
for the DOM WG.
