here is a proposal:
[[
While serializing a document the serializer will write out non-specified
values (such as attributes whose specified is false) if the
discard-default-content feature is set to true. If the
discard-default-content flag is set to false and a schema is used for
validation, the schema will be also used to determine if a value is
specified or not. If no schema is used, the specified flag on attribute
nodes is used to determine if attribute values should be written out.
