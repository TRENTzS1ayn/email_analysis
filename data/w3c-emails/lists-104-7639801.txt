Can someone clarify the getElementsByName method for me. It appears in DOM1 
but not in DOM2 or DOM3 WD. I see that it exists both in IE6 and in NS6 - 
although it doesn't seem to work on the SVG documents that I have tested it 
in. Has it been removed from the spec? If not should it be available on 
documentElements other than the <html> element. For example should it be 
available on the <svg> element?

Thanks in advance,

Jonathan.
