I see. Thanks Boris.

Can I suggest that getElementsByName would be just as useful in other 
things (as well as HTML). In fact often even more so. In HTML many 
collections already exist, but not so for something like SVG. Hence if I 
create some radio buttons in an SVG document and give them all the same 
name I don't have the advantage of a collection ready made as I would in HTML.

It would be very useful if getElementsByName was moved back to DOM-Core. Is 
there any reason that it was thought to be specific to HTML?

Can I have your thoughts please?

Jonathan.
