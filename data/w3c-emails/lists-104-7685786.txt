The :indeterminate selector is in CSS3.  We cannot implement this
without a .indeterminate property in the DOM or an INDETERMINATE attr in
HTML, or by going beyond existing standards.

Is it OK for the CSS, DOM and HTML standards not to interoperate?  I am
willing to wait on this if it means we have time to properly hash out
whether it should be tri-state or quad-state.
