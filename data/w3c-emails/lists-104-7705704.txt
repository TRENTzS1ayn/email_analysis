Good question. Although the description of nodeValue explicitly says that
setting it is a no-op for nodes which can't have values, prefix doesn't
explicitly state what happens.

The "... this is always null" wording, without elaboration, generally does
mean the DOM WG's intent was that setting it would be a silent no-op.

But this is worth nailing down explicitly, and I don't see an already
existing erratum on this topic.
