Unless you're planning to implement our CSS engine on top of a generic
DOM Level 2 HTML implementation, I don't see how we prevent you from
adding this information in your implementation. You're missing lots of
information from DOM Level 2 HTML in order to implement a Web Browser on
top of it (:visited, ...) anyway.All we say is, we won't expose this
information to the DOM user.
