The current definition of the "checked" attribute on "input" has what I
think is a typo in it:

Changes to this attribute change the state of the form control, but do
not change the value of the HTML value attribute of the element.

I think that the intention was to say "do not change the value of the
HTML _checked_ attribute of the element." rather than value.
