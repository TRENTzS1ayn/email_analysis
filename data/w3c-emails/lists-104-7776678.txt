Hallo,

is there a common way to map the DOM IDL definitions to C++
abstract classes?
There is a one from the OMG, but that one is too CORBA oriented.

If there is none, could you please provide one? I would like to be sure
that my C++ DOM applications are conformal to the DOM standard.

Thanks.

Andre
