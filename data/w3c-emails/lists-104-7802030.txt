Hello,

thanks to the help I received I figured out my readonly question, but now
I'm having a little difficulty with the Attr node.

The documentation on Attr says that on setting the value attribute of
Attr, a Text node has to be created.
Do I have to update the value attribute and create a Text node with the
same contents as the value attribute ?

Thanks,

Mark Hellegers
