 Hello,
       I'm fairly new to the world of XML and I have a question
 concerning End-of-Line characters & End-of-File characters.  When XML
 parser validates an xml document for well-formness, how does it handle
 End-of-Line characters & End-of-File characters?  For example, say I
 have the following XML document ("$" denotes End-of-line characters):


 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>$

 How does DOMCount treat the end-of-line character between the DOCTYPE
 tag and the Namespace declaration?  I have bolded the $ that is being
 referred in the previous sentence.  Thank you for your patience.

 P.S.  If I am mailing the wrong work-group with this question, then
 please forgive me of my ignorance and kindly refer me to the correct
 work group in W3C.  Thank you.
