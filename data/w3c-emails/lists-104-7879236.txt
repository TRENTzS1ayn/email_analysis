Why does the DOMString type needs to be defined at all? I'm in
the middle of adding support for non-ascii character sets to my
DOMC module and decided the best thing to do was just support
the locale dependant encoding (and wchar_t as a compile time
option). I'm not sure if I'm going to do UTF-16 because there are no
support functions in my env. anyway.
