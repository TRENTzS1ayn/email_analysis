Well then the outward appearance to me is that the description of the Attr node's children is vague. Perhaps if I  understood XML well it might make sense but I don't and after looking over
the section on Attribute Types in the XML spec: http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006#attdecls, nothing really jumps out at me. It would be nice if you could spice up the description of
structurual requirements for Attr.
