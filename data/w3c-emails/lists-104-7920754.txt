Did a quick read.  The only two issues that immediately came to my mind have
already been raised by Jonas Sicking in
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom/2002JanMar/0106.html and
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom/2002JanMar/0113.html.
XPathResult should be removed as a parameter from the evaluate methods of
XPathEvaluator and XPathExpression since effective reuse is unlikely and
potential reuse is problematic and the ECMAScript binding should explicitly
address the implementation of XPathNSResolver by scripting code.
