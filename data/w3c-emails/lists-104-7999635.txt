Yuck. I had no idea you could do that. You're right. That is a real 
issue. My reading of the WD is that this would have the same effect 
as using number() or boolean() or string() on a node-set; that is, it 
returns the typed value of the first node and ignores the rest.

I suggest, however, that this functionality be dropped from DOM Level 
3 XPath. I don't think it lets developers do anything they can't 
already do with XPath functions. Dropping the in unsigned short type 
argument from evaluate() would simplify the API. I prefer a cleaner 
division between what's done in XPath and what's done in DOM.

On a related matter, I also think the earlier proposal to drop the in 
XPathResult result argument is also a good idea. This would reduce 
the number of arguments from 5 to 3, only one of which is optional 
(i.e. can be null). This seems much cleaner and much easier to teach 
and explain while not removing any significant functionality.
