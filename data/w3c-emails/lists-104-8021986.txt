I intend to submit some bugs for IE and Mozilla, but first I would like 
some clarification as to just where a handler for the load event should be 
set?

The two logical places seem to be to add it to 'document' or to 
'document.documentElement'. A bug in Mozilla suggests that, when they get 
it working, it will be added to 'document', yet in IE6 this causes an 
error. The other option, 'document.documentElement', doesn't seem to work 
for either browser.

Thanks in advance,

Jonathan.
