Hi,

The javadoc comment for getNodeValue() in org.w3c.dom.Node interface is having 
some problem. It says:

    /**
     * The value of this node, depending on its type; see the table above. 
     * When it is defined to be <code>null</code>, setting it has no effect.
     * @exception DOMException
     *   NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised when the node is readonly.
     * @exception DOMException
     *   DOMSTRING_SIZE_ERR: Raised when it would return more characters than 
     *   fit in a <code>DOMString</code> variable on the implementation 
     *   platform.
     */
     
But, getNodeValue(), never throws DOMException-NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR. 
Also, there is no javadoc for setNodeValue().

Same is true for get/setPrefix().

Can anybody tell me, where to file a bug for this?.

NOTE: This bug is in the zip available at: http://www.w3.org/DOM/DOMTR which I 
believe is the latest version. Please correct me, if I am wrong.

Suggestion: In some places the javadoc says: "see the table above". But, there 
is no table in the javadoc for the interface. It would be better to put the 
table there (the one which shows nodeName, nodeValue and attributes for various 
types of Nodes under Interface Node, in DOM L2 core).

Cheers,
Rahul.
