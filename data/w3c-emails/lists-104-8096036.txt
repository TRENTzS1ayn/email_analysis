If you apply several times a query that return a number, what would
prevent you of reusing the XPathResult? I can see for a node-set
conditions where you cannot reuse it but that would depend on how you
implement it.

agree. I do have some code somewhere to add this support in the XML
markup using role='ecmascript-function' (or role='java-only' if the
method/attribute should not appear in the ECMA binding).
