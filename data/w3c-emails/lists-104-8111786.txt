How about
[[
Support for the MathML Document Object Model may be queried by calling
the DOMImplementation::hasFeature method with the test string
"org.w3c.dom.mathml".
]]
http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-MathML2-20010221/chapter8.html#N41540

Given that they don't (forgot to?) provide a version number, using null
or empty string is safe.

You can also use this feature with Node.isSupported.
