Another comment on the Load/Save draft.  This relates to item 8 from
my previous post:

http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-dom/2002JanMar/0193.html

The DOMBuilder supports a "feature" called "create-entity-nodes"; is
there a reason to also define "create-notation-nodes"?  There's
definately less need to provide a filter of this sort.  Perhaps there
should be an option to not build the DocumentType node at all, even if
present?
