XML text files can carry an optional byte order mark at the start of the
file (before the XML Declaration or Text Declaration, if any). It's the
responsibility of the parser and/or serializer to deal with that... so
outside of the question this raises about whether our Load/Store API needs
an option to control whether a BOM is to be generated, I don't think we
have to worry about it.


Java serialization is irrelevant to the DOM API, and I'm not quite sure why
we're discussing it... or why the byte ordering question came up in the
first place. The byte order in the DOMString is that of whatever datatype
the binding has used as its DOMString type, and the programmer generally
doesn't care.
