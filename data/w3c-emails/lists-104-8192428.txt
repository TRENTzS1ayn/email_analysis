Hi,
How do a create a node (element, fragment) and add
other nodes to it where this node will be part of a
DOM_Document later on.  It appears that all the
factory methods for creating nodes are in
DOM_Document.  So is there anyway I can create a node
from scratch, add children, and then add it to the
DOM_Document later?

Thanks,
Chris
