Dear all!

I propose to use the Java collections framework in the interface for the
NamedNodeMap and the NodeList. The both should have the method

public Collection getNodes();

The advantage of using the collection framework are manifold:
- Takes care for concurrent modifications (while iterating over the
collectioin).
- Provides useful methods for collections (like sorting)
- The collection framework is natural to use in Java


In addition I propose to deprecate the method

public Node getItem(int anIndex)

at the NamedNodeMap because it is akward to implement and is only meant to
have a convient way to iterate over the nodes. But this is exactly no longer
necessary when the collections framework is used.

Thanks for your attention,
--Stefan
