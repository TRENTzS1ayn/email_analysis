Dear all!

In the current draft of the abstract schemas object model the allowed
strings for an attribute with an enumeration constraint are represented by a
comma-separated list.

The problem is that the the enumeration facet of XML-Schema always arbitrary
strings to be enumerated. Therefore XML-Schema enumeration constraint can
not always be expressed with a corresponding AS attribute declaration.

I propose to have a list of arbitrary string to represent the enumeration
constraint.

Thanks for your attention,
--Stefan
