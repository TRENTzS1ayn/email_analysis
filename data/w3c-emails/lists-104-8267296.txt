Won't happen. Part of the point of the DOM is portability; changing basic
APIs at this late date would break that. Also, you're neglecting the fact
that DOM NodeLists and NamedNodeMaps have some behaviors which differ from
those of the Java collections -- liveness and namespace sensitivity are the
most obvious ones.

You can certainly use the Java collections framework  _inside_ an
implementation of the DOM. But the whole point of an API is that it defines
very specific names and behaviors. If you change those, you have not
implemented the same API.
