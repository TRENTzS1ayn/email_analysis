Erm ... shouldn't that argument be getting applied to DOM's use
of its own nonstandard language mapping for OMG-IDL?

DOM has already done that.  Its language mapping is nonstandard.

All those DOM-ish generic data structure efforts (DOM4J, JDOM,
and more) are doing is going a bit further along that path.  I don't
see why DOM itself shouldn't do that.
