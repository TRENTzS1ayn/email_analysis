See past discussion re filtering in the Traversal chapter. The decision
there was that whatToShow was not mutable (allowing it to change seemed to
unreasonably constrain implementations), but you can achieve the desired
results by specifying SHOW_ALL and then make all the decisions, including
node-type, dynamically in your filter logic. I'd avoid doing something
different here unless there is an extremely good reason, simply to ease the
task of learning how to use the DOM.
