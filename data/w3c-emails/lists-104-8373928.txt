In the DOM 3 Events an click is defined as:
\"The click event occurs when the pointing device button is clicked over an 
element. A click is defined as a mousedown and mouseup over the same screen 
location.\"

In Windows and IE GUI a click is interpreted as an mousedown and mouseup over 
the same element (icon or button in HTML) there is no need for this two to 
happen on the exact screen point and the pointer could be moved eaven out of 
the element while the mouse button is pressed.

I think that DOM events should support the same behaveour for the click as 
existing user agents. The specification should be more clear about it, adding a 
new event or better addin an attribute that defines if there was a move over 
the element or out of the element between the mousedown and mouseup. For 
dragable objects there is a minimum move for the click to become a drag.

Some SVG software triggers a click only if the mouse is clicked on a single 
point this is not against the dom specification, but is against what users are 
used to define a click.
