Minutes 3/6/2002
Attendees: Ben, Kim, Mike, Patty, Rob, Hiro, Ray, Philippe, Arnaud, Jerone
Regrets: Dimitris

F2F: Rob to pick some dates in August/September and to verify that he can host.

Core Issues: 
1) Normalize NS6: What happens with read only nodes?
Resolution: Irrelevant issue.

2) Issue normalizeNS-9: 
What happens with regard to mutation events? 
Mutation Events: do people expect mutation events to fire during normalization.
Ray: a minimal set of nodes are mutated.
Resolution: We won't have as many events as we first thought, so this probably isn't bad to fire the events.

3) Issue renameNode-1: 
Should this throw a HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR? 
Resolution: No

4) issue 
Philippe: Action item check the status of  "format canonical feature"
5) Issue normalizationFeature-13: 
Shouldn't we change this to setting the relevant options back to their default value? 
Debate over whether this feature should exist or not, since it is really just a convenience feature.
Resolution: Issue withdrawn by Arnaud.

6) Issue: whitespace in element content and validate feature (interaction?)
Ray: this feature should only be set during load and normalization
Resolution: this should be nailed down when arnaud nails down iswhitespace elementcontent.  They should work in a similar way.
