> Minutes 3/6/2002
> Attendees: Ben, Kim, Mike, Patty, Rob, Hiro, Ray, Philippe, Arnaud, Jerone
> Regrets: Dimitris
>
> F2F: Rob to pick some dates in August/September and to verify that he can host.
>
> Core Issues:
> 1) Normalize NS6: What happens with read only nodes?
> Resolution: Irrelevant issue.
>
> 2) Issue normalizeNS-9:
> What happens with regard to mutation events?
> Mutation Events: do people expect mutation events to fire during normalization.
> Ray: a minimal set of nodes are mutated.
> Resolution: We won't have as many events as we first thought, so this probably isn't bad to fire
the events.
>
> 3) Issue renameNode-1:
> Should this throw a HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR?
> Resolution: No
>
> 4) issue
> Philippe: Action item check the status of  "format canonical feature"
> 5) Issue normalizationFeature-13:
> Shouldn't we change this to setting the relevant options back to their default value?
> Debate over whether this feature should exist or not, since it is really just a convenience
feature.
> Resolution: Issue withdrawn by Arnaud.
>
> 6) Issue: whitespace in element content and validate feature (interaction?)
> Ray: this feature should only be set during load and normalization
> Resolution: this should be nailed down when arnaud nails down iswhitespace elementcontent.  They
should work in a similar way.
