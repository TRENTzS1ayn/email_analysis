Since I'm into checking the resolutions of our f2f, let me report that
you've got your "namespaces" feature back in the LS specification (issue
LS-101 in the to-publish-asap-version). Namespace processing is required
for DOM LS implementation and is the default behavior. Being able to
desactivate namespace processing (ie being able to set the feature to
false) is not required for implementation.
