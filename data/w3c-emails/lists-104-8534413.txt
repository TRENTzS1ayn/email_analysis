One use case: Impedence matching between the DOM and the XPath Data Model.
XPath sees all adjacent text as a single value; this attribute permits the
DOM to support that by returning the first text node and assuming the
caller is clueful enough to retrieve wholetext rather than just nodevalue.

It's arguably just a convenience method, but a useful and frequently
requested one -- especially given the proposal that the DOM provide an
XPath API.

No, it _shouldn't_ be on the parent; there may be non-text children as
well, and wholeText just accesses a single adjacent text block rather than
all text children.
