In real use cases, forcing the user to expand them before he uses

It's not deprecation. XPath 1.0 is quite clear that entity references 
must be expanded. Section 5.2 of the XPath spec states, "Entity 
references to both internal and external entities are expanded. 
Character references are resolved." Unexpanded entity references were 
never allowed in XPath in the first place so they can't be deprecated 
now.
