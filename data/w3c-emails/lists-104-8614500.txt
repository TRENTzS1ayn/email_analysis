No, the URI of the frame is never readable from a document unless the 
document comes from the same host that the frame comes from (unless you 
change document.domain). It doesn't matter if the document that is 
trying to access the src is the document that contains the frame. 
Imagine yourself browsing to evil.com and they put up a whole page frame 
and load some other site into that frame, from there on, evil.com could 
track what pages you're browsing in that window w/o you knowing it until 
you cause the surrounding frame to be unloaded. That would not be 
acceptable from a privacy point of view.
