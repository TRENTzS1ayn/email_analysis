This makes it easier to use an Outlook filter on it.  Otherwise I have to
move those messages manually, which is very annoying.

Thanks a lot for your understanding.

If the DOM Event APIs are exposed, I don't see any way to prevent a
relationship from being established manually -- at least not within the
scope of the DOM as currently designed.

This sounds like an issue for a security-aware subclass of the DOM, and I
don't think that flavor is even on the Open Issues List yet. It may come
closest to the read-only DOM proposal, or perhaps the transactional
proposal... but I think one can make a good case for it being best left as
something for higher-level code to define and deal with, since different
contexts may have significantly different concerns.
