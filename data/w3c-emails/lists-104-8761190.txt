Looking at existing implementations, Netscape does accept the element
on add. They don't do validation on this call. The element is not
returned in the list of options but does appear as a child of the
element table. IE on the other hand, does have a minimal validation in
this case and ignore the new element (ie it is a no-op in that case).
So, facing differences in implementations, we added:
[[
This method may have no effect if the new element is not an OPTION or an
OPTGROUP.
]]
