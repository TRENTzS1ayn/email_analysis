Is there any W3C standardization effort on the "Browser Object Model"
used by popular web browsers (Netscape and Internet Explorer) in JavaScript?
Such as window.alert() to bring up a dialog box.

This doesn't seems to be part of W3C DOM, and perhaps it shouldn't be.
But it's neither part if the ECMAScript standard, so there is a gap.
The implementation by Microsoft and Netscape are not the same (though they are similar), so some standardization would be nice.
