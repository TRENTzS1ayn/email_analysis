Hi everyone!
Here goes my complaints:

1 - Interface EventGroup: in the definition of this interface, it's mentioned a "new EventTargetGroup interface" that doesn't exist.

2 - Interface CustomEvent: it says: "It is intented to be used by the DOM implementation to access the underlying while ...". First, it should be "INTENDED", second, access the underlying WHAT?
And regarding this interface, how is the DOM implementation supposed to change the currentTarget and phase attributes if they are readOnly in the Event interface and it doesn't have the CustomEvent methods? It seems to me that all events must have these two methods, or maybe the attributes should be made read/write.

Thanks,
Daniel Cazzulino
