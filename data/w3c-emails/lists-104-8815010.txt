On behalf of the DOM Working Group, I am pleased to announce the
publication of the DOM Level 3 XPath Last Call draft.

This document provides simple functionalities to access a DOM tree using
XPath 1.0.

The review period ends on May 1, 2002.

Comments from any Working Group or member of the Community are welcome
on www-dom@w3.org.

All comments sent to the mailing list will be recorded at [1] and
presented to the Director before moving to Candidate Recommendation.

If you sent comments in the past and never received a response (or
disagreed with the response), please forgive us and resend your comments
in the mailing list. If, at the end of the Last Call period, you are
still in disagreement, please say so.

The DOM WG is already looking for implementations of the draft. If you,
or your company, are planning to implement (or already has an
implementation of) this DOM module and are willing to participate in the
Candidate Recommendation phase with your implementation, please let us
know by sending a message to the public mailing list www-dom@w3.org.

Thank you,

Philippe,
for the DOM WG.
