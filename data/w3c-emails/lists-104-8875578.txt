No different from any other mutable object, right? If this is a concern for
the user, s/he passes in null and obtains a new instance. If they _know_
they can safely reuse, they do so.

Give them the tool, let them figure out when to use it and when not to.

Frankly, that strikes me as overkill -- if you don't _know_ that it's
reusable in your context you should assume it isn't, again just like any
other mutable object -- but if folks really thought a safety net was
necessary ...
