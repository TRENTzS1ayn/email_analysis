Hello:

I noticed:

    normalizeDocument introduced in DOM Level 3 
        This method acts as if the document was going through
        a save and load cycle, putting the document in a "normal"
        form. The actual result depends on the features being set
        and governing what operations actually take place. See
        <<setNormalizeFeature>> for details.

Should that be setNormalizationFeature?

Thanks

-John
