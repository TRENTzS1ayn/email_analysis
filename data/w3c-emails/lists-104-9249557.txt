Hi,

I'm currently looking into the DOM Level 3 Abstract Schemas spec, which exactly fits my needs. Is this mailing list the best place to discuss issues about it, or is there a better place? Where can I send comments? 

What is the status of Abstract Schemas? I get surprisingly few infos when I do web searches. Is it in active development, are there competing standards that take over? 

Thanks,
alex :-)
