Hi,

after appending an Element to the root node
it is not possible to reffer to it by
"getElementById",
even though this method works on all other 
nodes I parses in before with the help
of the DocumentBuilderFactory.
After saving and reloading i can refer
to the new Node by getElementById.

How can I make "getElementById" work
for appended elements?

Thanks for reply

Marcel
