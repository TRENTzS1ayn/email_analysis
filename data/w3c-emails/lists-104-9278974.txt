Marcel,

If you are referring to the JAXP implementation of DOM, call the
setIdAttributeName() method of the added ElementNode. It helps, although in
my opinion it should not be necessary, since the DTD already describes the
id attribute and the node is created by the document. Thus it should already
know what attribute is the id.

Cheers
Andy
