Hi there,

I haven't found any support in the Abstract Schema spec for the XML Schema inheritance mechanisms through substitutionGroup. How is this handled, through ASContentModel with CHOICE_CM? 

I think that it would make sense to expose inheritance relations through an abstract schema API. Consumers of this API, such as graphical browsers of abstract schemas, could make advantage by showing types with commonalities different than unrelated types in a choice. 

Thanks,
alex :-)
