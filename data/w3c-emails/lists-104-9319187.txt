Announcement regarding work on DOM Abstract Schema:

The "Document Editing" part of Abstract Schema has been split out as a 
new "Validation" module.  Work on the remaining Abstract Schema module 
has been stopped, and this module will not be advanced by the DOM 
working group at this time.  Work on the new Validation module continues.
