DOM XPath module last call issue A1 was about whether an implementation 
is required to reuse an XPath result.  The resolution of this issue is 
as follows:  

This is clearly the intent of the group that no implementation should be 
required to reuse the result. The specification has been modified to now 
say "does not" instead of "cannot", eliminating any suggestion that the 
implementation is required to try to reuse the result.

See the issues list for more complete information at 
http://www.w3.org/2002/03/DOM-Level-3-XPath-issues/all.html#a1

Please let us know if you are, or are not, satisfied with this resolution.
