DOM XPath module last call issue a2 was about whether the API is 
justified in permitting the result to be explicitly reused.  The 
resolution of this issue is that the decision was made that no change 
was desired to the API.

See the issues list for more complete information at 
http://www.w3.org/2002/03/DOM-Level-3-XPath-issues/all.html#a2

Please let us know if you are, or are not, satisfied with this resolution.
