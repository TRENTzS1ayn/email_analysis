DOM XPath module last call issue a3 was about the impact of possible 
future incompatible changes to the fields of the XPath node.  The 
resolution of this issue is that the following text was added:

"In future versions of the XPath specification, the definition of a 
namespace node may be changed incompatibly, in which case incompatible 
changes to field values may be required to implement versions beyond 
XPath 1.0."

See the issues list for more complete information at 
http://www.w3.org/2002/03/DOM-Level-3-XPath-issues/all.html#a3

Please let us know if you are, or are not, satisfied with this resolution.
