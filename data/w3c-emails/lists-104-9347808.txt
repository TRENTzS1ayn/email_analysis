DOM XPath module last call issue a4 was about certain fields in the 
description of the namespace node that were underspecified.  The 
resolution of this issue is that the specification of those fields seems 
appropriate to the working group:

"/ All attributes of Node not described in this section have a |null| or 
|false| value. /"

"/|prefix| is the prefix of the namespace represented by the node./"

"/|nodeName| is the same as |prefix"|/

See the issues list for more complete information at 
http://www.w3.org/2002/03/DOM-Level-3-XPath-issues/all.html#a4

Please let us know if you are, or are not, satisfied with this resolution.
