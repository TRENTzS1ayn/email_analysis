  1.  LAST CALL ANNOUNCEMENT: DOM EVENTS

This is the last call announcement from the W3C DOM Working Group (DOM 
WG) for review of the DOM Level 3 Events Specification.

2. REQUEST FOR DOCUMENT REVIEW

The DOM WG asks for review of the following document:

Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Events Specification

Abstract: "This specification defines the Document Object Model Events 
Level 3, a generic platform- and language-neutral event system which 
allows registration of event handlers, describes event flow through a 
tree structure, and provides basic contextual information for each 
event.  The Document Object Model Events Level 3 builds on the Document 
Object Model Events Level 2."

The document is available at:

http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20020712/

See Appendix A for a list of changes between DOM Level 2 Events and DOM 
Level 3 Events specifications.
