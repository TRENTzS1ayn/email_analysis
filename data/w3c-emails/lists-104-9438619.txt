Hi Thomas,

MSXML4.0 is one parser, there are many, many others.
Some IMHO very popular examples are Xerces and Saxon.
Both are available for C++ as well as for Java.

You do not need a database, since XML documents could
be also stored as plain files. But RDBMSs like DB2 or Oracle
offer XML functionality. There also exist some OODBMS with
XML functionality. And exen dedicated XML databases are
available.

So far I only dealt with XML in Java or C++ codes. So I cannot
tell  you how to process XML using js or PHP.

Carsten
