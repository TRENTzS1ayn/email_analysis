I believe this is not a call that is a part of the standard w3c DOM 
interfaces.

I also do not recognize CONSTRAINT_ERROR.

This list is best at describing how a DOM implementation should work, 
according to the W3C specification.  If you are making calls not 
documented in the standard API, and it is raising exceptions not listed 
in the specification's description of GetElementsByTagName, then you 
need to talk to your vendor about that.  You did not mention who 
produced the DOM implementation you are using or what modules it 
included.  I believe there would be an appropriate support list for most 
DOM implementations for problems with private extensions of that 
particular framework.
