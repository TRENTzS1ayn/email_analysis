In IE I can do this 
Window.location.replace(url)

To change the location and the history. 

How would I do this according to the DOM so it will work with mozilla
based browsers?

P.S. Sorry I haven't spent any time lurking on the list to be sure that
this is a relevant question. I did try to search the archives .
