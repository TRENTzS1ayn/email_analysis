It seems like for symmetry, it should be possible to save a Node to a URI, not just load it from a URI.  Also, in our case, we can implement load/save directly from database native storage rather than requiring it to be streamed as text at any point, and since we use URI's to identify where the native storage is, this would provide an interoperable way of accessing both file & database storage for XML.
