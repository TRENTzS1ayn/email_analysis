I would hope the intent is  to support whatever line-break is appropriate 
for the platform which the load/save code is running on -- same variation 
as in the XML Recommendation's description of end-of-line representations 
and handling, plus whatever was done about the EBCDIC newline character 
(which, annoyingly, has its own Unicode code point)..

So if you really have a platform where end of line is marked as the string 
"EOL" -- extremely non-useful since this would conflict with many, many 
text files --  then yes, I'd expect that string to appear in this 
property. That's not exactly likely to ever arise, but -- again -- 
consider the EBCDIC case, and then consider that someone else may invent 
yet another Unicode code point for the same purpose (sigh) and we don't 
want to have to rewrite our spec to let someone Do The Right Thing.

So I'm not convinced it's the DOM's responsibility to sanity-check this 
value. if someone gives us a weird definition of newline, we should 
probably take their word for it, and leave the question of warning 
messages as a quality-of-implementation issue.
