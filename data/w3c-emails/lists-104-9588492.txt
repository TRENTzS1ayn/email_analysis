I raised a similar issue with DOM L3 XPath.  It could be difficult to distinguish between a DOMException and a ExceptionVAL in a weakly typed language since the code values overlap.  It would be beneficial if code values not used by other DOM Exceptions could be assigned to NO_GRAMMAR_AVAILABLE and VALIDATION_ERR.
