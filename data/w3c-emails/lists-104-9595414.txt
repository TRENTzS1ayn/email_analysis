In fact, this explains why DOM Level 1 SE is on hold for the moment. We
would like to put a sentence in the SE version recommending users to use
DOM Level 2 HTML instead of DOM Level 1 HTML, due to the
incompatibilities. But we cannot put this comment until DOM Level 2 is
approved as a W3C Recommendation.
Hopefully, we'll be able to run the tests suite against IE, Netscape,
and Opera at the end of August and move out of the CR phase after that.
