I found the descripton of the CustomEvent interface in the Last Call
draft of the Level 3 Events spec too be very confusing.  I was only able
to figure it out after reading the note about it in the description of
DocumentEvent.createEvent().  I suggest you add more description to
CustomEvent itself.  In particular, please say when it is necessary to
implement this interface.
