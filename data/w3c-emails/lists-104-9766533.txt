Hello DOMers,

I have been looking at the DOM level two interfaces from the W3C site, and
am a little confused by what (in my na?ve view) seems to be a contradiction
between the DOM spec and the Java bindings. If this is unutterably trivial,
then please excuse me!

http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-DOM-Level-2-Core-20001113/core.html in section
1.1. states "Finally, the interfaces Text, Comment, and CDATASection all
inherit from the CharacterData interface."

http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-DOM-Level-2-Core-20001113/java-binding.html in
the "org/w3c/dom/CDATASection.java" section, the following appears:

package org.w3c.dom;

public interface CDATASection extends Text{
}

Which clearly does not extend the CharacterData interface but in fact the
Text interface (which itself extends the CharacterData interface).

Are the Java language bindings definitive on the Java platform and was there
some good reason for tweaking the spec in these bindings which I haven't
figured out? Should I assume that the spec or the Java bindings are
authoritative?

Thanks,

Jim
