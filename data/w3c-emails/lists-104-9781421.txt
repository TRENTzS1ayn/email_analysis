An interface inherits from all the types the superclasses do, just as I 
inherit not only from my parents, but from my grandparents.  If you use 
the Java "instanceof" operator, you will find that Text is indeed an 
instance of CharacterData.  The IDL interface definitions appear to me 
to be identical to the Java in this respect, unless I missed something 
you are trying to point out.
