Hi,

I need some clarifications.

http://www.w3.org/2002/08/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20020806/events.html

1.3. Default actions and cancelable events

"Some events are specified as cancelable. For these events, the DOM
implementation generally has a default action associated with the event,
which is not part of the DOM event flow."


[1]
Does that mean that no-cancelable events can't have a default action? Or
does that mean there is simply no way to prevent a default action to be
executed on a no-cancelable event?

[2] The concept of default action is not well specified. Conceptually, is
there a user agent default action per element and per event type *or*  one
user agent default action per event type whatever the event target is.

Thierry.
