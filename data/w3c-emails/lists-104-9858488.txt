Hello all,

The "form" attribute was removed from the HTMLObjectElement in DOM Level
2 HTML at the early stages of the updating of the spec since the thought
at the time was that there were no implementations of this attribute.
Later on we realized that the removal of that attribute was wrong since
there are indeed implementations of that attribute (MS IE implements it)
so we decided to add it back, but this decision was lost and the
incorrect change was never reverted. The attribute will now be added
back to the spec, i.e. the incorrect change that took the attribute out
will be reverted. An updated version of the current DOM Level 2 HTML CR
will be published soon.
