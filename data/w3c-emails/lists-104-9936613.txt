We would like to propose an erratum to DOM2 HTML regarding the rowIndex property of HTMLTableRowElement. This is so the DOM2 HTML specification will reflect the behavior of 2 currently interoperable implementations: IE 6 for Windows and Netscape 6.

Where the specification reads: "This is in document tree order and not display order. The rowIndex does not take into account sections (THEAD, TFOOT, or TBODY) within the table." 

The proposed erratum is: "This is in logical order and not in document order. The rowIndex does take into account sections (THEAD, TFOOT, or TBODY) within the table, placing THEAD rows first in the index, followed by TBODY rows, followed by TFOOT rows."

The documentation of the rowIndex parameter for HTMLTableElement::deleteRow and HTMLTableElement::insertRow could be clarified by language similar to the proposed erratum. For example, the HTMLTableElement::deleteRow specification currently states "This index starts from 0 and is relative to all the rows contained inside the table, regardless of section parentage." "Regardless of section parentage" could mean order within the table element of the document, or display order.
