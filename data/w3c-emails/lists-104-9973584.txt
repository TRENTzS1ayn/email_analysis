I'm not sure if this comment is appropriate here, or on the html list.

The reason that there aren't any examples is because it was never 
implemented by a major browser.  But there are certainly strong use 
cases for wanting this feature.  The case I wanted it for was a visual 
navigation system across multiple pages of a web site.  The example site 
I was working on in 2000 was http://www.westcoastinternet.net/ .  I 
settled for using DOM methods to add the necessary image map (about 100 
entries) to each document, but it would have been much more convenient 
for me to link to an external document, and presumably loading would be 
more efficient.

My point... there are good use cases, so I'm not convinced it should be 
completely dropped without further consideration.
