The name change to "DOMParser" is confusing to our users since we already have a public class called DOMParser (oracle.xml.parser.v2.DOMParser) and from a quick google search, it looks like Xerces might also have one (namely org.apache.xerces.parser.DOMParser )  If there is no "specific" reason for changing the name to DOMParser, it will be preferred if the name is changed back to DOMBuilder.

This was discussed in the DOM WG and the group decided to change the 
names yet one more time, this time to LSParser, and hopefully this will 
resolve the name conflict in all cases. The group didn't like the name 
Builder, nor Writer, so for consistecy's sake the group made the 
decision to rename DOMParser and DOMSerializer to LSParser and 
LSSerializer (and same for the filters).
