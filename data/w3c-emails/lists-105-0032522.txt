Users *are* able to check if the "true" value is implemented or not. 
Using the DOMConfiguration object, a user can call 
config.canSetParameter("check-character-normalization", true), and that 
will tell them if the implementation supports character normalization 
checking. The DOM Level 3 Load and Save (and DOM Level 3 Core) specs do 
not *require* that implementations *must* support character normalization.

As for DocumentLS, that interface is no longer part of the LS spec.
