Agreed. I don't think there's anything that really can be fixed here, 
but DOM Level 3 (and maybe arratas to older versions) could explain the 
intended behavior better here, and IMO the DOM TS should not make an 
implementation fail if it doesn't throw a *DOM exception* when a 
negative value is passed as an unsigned type.
