This, I'm sure, is going to irk developers using DOM3. If the precedence is being left undefined so that browser-authors can determine the best error to throw on a case-by-case basis, leaving it out of the scope of the document until, perhaps, DOM4, then I suppose I understand; you can only accomplish so much in one standard.

But at some point developers will want to be able to predict for any set of errors what one error they will receive. Otherwise, a try/catch in a language like Java or Javascript is going to produce varying results for the same error browser to browser. This is sure to be a sore spot for developers once DOM3 proliferates.
