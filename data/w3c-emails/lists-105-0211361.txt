If the precedence is being left undefined so that browser-authors can determine the best error to throw on a case-by-case basis, leaving it out of the scope of the document until, perhaps, DOM4, then I suppose I understand; you can only accomplish so much in one standard.

This has been in DOM since DOM Level 1 and we don't plan to render
current implementations non-conformant.

Otherwise, a try/catch in a language like Java or Javascript is going to produce varying results for the same error browser to browser. This is sure to be a sore spot for developers once DOM3 proliferates.

The program is in fault since it's trying to do an invalid operation. If
more than one valid case applies, the program needs to be fixed imho.
