But it does have the concept of indices, and it does already have an appropriate Exception to raise:

IndexOutOfBoundsException
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/lang/IndexOutOfBoundsException.html

If the language does not have the proper typing means to handle the spec, the language should still be called on for resolving this "unsigned" issue rather than the DOM. The Java implementation ought to work around Java's limitation by handling this index as Java already does handle every other index natively - by offering an int argument and throwing an IndexOutOfBoundsException if the argument is negative.

This would resolve the DOM compliance test issue, as the DOM index exception would no longer be necessary.
