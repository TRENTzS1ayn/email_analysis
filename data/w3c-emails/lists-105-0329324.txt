Sure, the definition of what happens when xml-declaration is set to true 
is now as follows:

[[
         If a Document, Element, or Entity node is serialized, the
         XML declaration, or text declaration, should be included.
         The version (Document.xmlVersion if the document is a
         Level 3 document and the version is non-null, otherwise
         use the value "1.0"), and the output encoding (see
         LSSerializer.write for details on how to find the output
         encoding) is specified in the serialized XML declaration.
]]
