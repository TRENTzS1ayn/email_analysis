[my apologies if this is a duplicate-topic email--company's email 
servers crashed yesterday and, not seeing an email from me in the 
archives, I'm unsure if the original made it through]

In working on ObjJob (http://phrogz.dnsalias.net/ObjJob/) and parsing 
the ECMAScript binding for DOM 2 Events, my parser found an object of 
type 'long' mentioned in several locations. For example:

The UIEvent object has the following methods:
initUIEvent(typeArg, canBubbleArg, cancelableArg, viewArg, detailArg)
... The detailArg parameter is a long object.

The MouseEvent object has the following properties:
screenX ... This read-only property is a long object.
screenY ... This read-only property is a long object.
clientX ... This read-only property is a long object.
clientY ... This read-only property is a long object.

I assume that this refers to a long integer, which is fine for the 
specification. However, as ECMAScript does not differentiate between 
floats and ints, having only a Number type, I believe instances of the 
word 'long' in the ECMAScript binding should be replaced with Number.

I will certainly be doing so in ObjJob, and making a note of the 
original spec in the comments. If this is incorrect, if I'm overlooking 
an officially-defined 'long' object, please let me know.
