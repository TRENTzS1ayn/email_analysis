We change NameList: "ordered collection of parallel pairs of name and
namespace values (which could be null values)"

Fixed.

Correct. This depends on its usage. NameList is meant to be a generic
interface and used in different ways depending on the context. The DOM
Level 3 Validation draft has been clarified to make that context clear:
[[
if the schema is a DTD, the element information item names are simply
local names; if the schema is a W3C XML schema, the names are qualified
names, which may contain namespace prefixes.
]]

We removed the exceptions to match NodeList.

Correct, since the index is unsigned. Given the recent discussion on
this list, it looks like we may need to say something about that. Not
sure if it will end up in the draft before the publication of the
candidate recommendation.

We are now matching NodeList.
