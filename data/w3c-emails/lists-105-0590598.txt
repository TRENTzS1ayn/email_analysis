The first sentence was reworded:
[[

An element's prefix/namespace URI pair is said to be within the scope of
a binding if its namespace prefix is bound to the same namespace URI in
the [in-scope namespaces] defined in [XML Information Set]. 
]]

We looked for further changes without much to do however. The third
paragraph was slightly tweaked to use prefix/namespace URI pair.

Hope those changes helps understanding this section,

Philippe
