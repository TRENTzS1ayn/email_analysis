Looking at the latest internal spec
(http://www.w3.org/2003/09/WD-DOM-Level-3-LS-20030918/load-save.html#LS-LSSe
rializer), I see this within the description of the true value of the
xml-declaration parameter of the config attribute of LSSerializer (phew!
that's deep!):

? The version [...] and the output encoding (see LSSerializer.write for
details on how to find the output encoding) is specified in the serialized
XML declaration. ?

This is fairly satisfactory, apart from a little grammatical problem
(s/is/are/) and the following issue:  Charmod section 3.6.2
(http://www.w3.org/International/Group/charmod-edit/Overview.html#sec-Encodi
ngIdent) says that "[S]  If the unique encoding approach is not taken,
specifications SHOULD mandate the use of the IANA charset registry names,
and in particular the names identified in the registry as 'MIME preferred
names', to designate character encodings in protocols, data formats and
APIs."  XML 1.0 (and the upcoming 1.1) also mandate IANA names, or x- for
private encodings.

We would appreciate if you could add a little bit of text (or a ref to
Charmod 3.6.2) to properly mandate IANA encoding names.
