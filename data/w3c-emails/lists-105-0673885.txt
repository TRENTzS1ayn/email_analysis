One of the reasons the this request was rejected is that the WG wants 
existing DOM serializers be wrappable in an LS serializer w/o changes to 
the existing serializer (which may or my not be in control of who's 
wrapping it in an LSSerializer interface) and still be able to claim 
compliance (which wouldn't be possible if the existing serializer 
character references in a way that didn't follow what's required by the 
LS spec).
