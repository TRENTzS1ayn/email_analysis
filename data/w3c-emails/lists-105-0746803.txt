It would be dangerous to start doing "magic" based on the value of the
standalone attribute. XML Parsers are required to check the value of
standalone when validating. It is therefore logic to do the same in the
DOM and make the check dependent on the validate and validate-if-schema
parameters. No change is needed in the specifications since this error
type is already controlled by XML.
