Hi:

[1] read

"#  FILTER_SKIP if the Element  should be rejected. All of its children 
are inserted in place of the rejected Element node. This return value 
will be ignored if element is the documentElement, the documentElement 
cannot be rejected nor skipped. "

1) Does it mean ALL children will be insreted in place of skipped
    Element ?
2) Why *rejected* is used for *skipped* seems editorial issue ?

Thanks
- Gopal
