It is consistent with our Java bindings rules:
- IDL attributes always starts witl lowercase.
- an IDL attribute is mapped to get and set methods (depending on
readonly or not).
- For the get, the prefix "get" is added at the beginning of the
attribute name and the first letter of the attribute name becomes
uppercase.
- ditto for the set, but with the prefix "set".

The only (new) exception to those rules is if the attribute starts with
"is" which is followed by an uppercase letter. In such case, the get
method has the same name as the attribute itself. The set method, "is"
is replaced by "set". The only exception to this rule is
HTMLImageElement.isMap.
