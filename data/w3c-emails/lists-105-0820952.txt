    For example, the MathML [MathML 2.0] and SVG [SVG 1.0]
    specifications are developing DOM extensions to allow users to
    manipulate instances of these vocabularies using semantics
    appropriate to images and mathematics (respectively) as well as the
    generic DOM XML semantics.

"images and mathematics (respectively)" should be changed to 
"mathematics and images, respectively,"
