http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Core/core.html#DOMFeatures

    For example, this specification defines the features "Core" and
    "XML", and thus for the versions"1.0", "2.0", and "3.0".

The "and thus" appears to be extraneous.  You would expect it to 
introduce a statement that would be true because this specification 
defined the specified features.

    As discussed Mixed DOM implementations, DOM Level 3 Core should be
    able to collaborate with subcomponents implementing specific DOMs.
    For that effect, the methodsDOMImplementation.getFeature(feature,
    version) and Node.getFeature(feature, version)were introduced. If a
    plus sign "+" is prepended to any feature name, implementations are
    considered in which the specified feature may not be directly
    castable but would require discovery through getFeature. Without a
    plus, only features whose interfaces are directly castable are
    considered.

getFeature ignores any leading "+" sign so introducing the convention of 
a leading plus sign within that context is a bit confusing.
