    Because parameters are exposed as properties in the ECMAScript
    Language Binding, names are recommended to follow the section "5.16
    Identifiers" of [Unicode] with the addition of the character '-'
    (HYPHEN-MINUS) but it is not enforced by the DOM implementation.

The configuration parameters do not appear to be exposed as properties 
in the ECMAScript language binding.  If they were, allowing hyphen-minus 
would probably cause significant issues.

    DOM Level 3 Core Implementations are required to recognize all
    parameters defined in this specification.

Many of the parameters are XML specific.  The current DOM spec preserves 
the distinction between Fundamental and Extended interfaces leaving the 
possibility for a L3 Core conformant implementation for HTML or another 
markup language.  Possibly the list could be split into parameters 
supported by all implementations and parameters that are required to be 
supported by implementations that return true for hasFeature("XML", "3.0")
