"infoset" parameter:

The description of setting "infoset" to false says that "it has no 
effect".  That phrasing is used in other places in the recommendation to 
be a strict no operation, that is if you did

document.config.setParameter("infoset", true);
document.config.setParameter("infoset", false);

Then document.config.getParameter("infoset") would be true.  I don't 
think that was the intention.

"schema-location" parameter:

The note says that setting them "schema-location" is "illegal" when 
"schema" is not set.   Illegal would suggest that an exception should be 
thrown, though a NOT_SUPPORTED_ERR wouldn't be quite right.  I'd suggest 
changing "illegal" to "ignored".  Otherwise, you would need to 
distinguishing setting the "schema-location" to null (which I would 
assume would be tolerated when "schema" is null) vs a non-null value.

"schema-type" parameter:

    If this parameter is not set, a default value may be provided by the
    implementation, based on the schema languages supported and on the
    schema language used at load time. If no value is provided, this
    parameter is null.

This suggests that an implementation might set this value in response to 
the document content.  That is if the document had a document type 
declaration but not a xsi:schemaLocation, then after parsing schema-type 
might be "defaulted" to http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml.   That would make 
this parameter the only one affected by document content.  I would 
suggest not implying that and if necessary to report the schema type 
used in validation that a readonly schemaType attribute be added to 
Document.

"well-formed" parameter

Suppressing well-formedness checking while loading an XML document would 
seem to be a direct contradition to the XML 1.0 spec which requires 
well-formedness violations to be fatal errors and prohibits normal 
continuation.  Maybe it is not so bad during a normalization, but 
allowing well-formedness to be disabled just seems wrong.
