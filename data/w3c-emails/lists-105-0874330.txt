Using the same method name for the "handle" method makes it difficult or 
impossible, depending on the binding, to implement both of these 
interfaces on the same object.

The interfaces are similar in intent to DOM Events' EventListener.  
Using Listener in one spec and Handler in another is potentially confusing.
