The parameter in NameList.contains is "name".  The parameter in 
DOMStringList.contains is "str".  Having a consistent parameter name 
simplifies DOMTS.  Document.getElementsByTagName and 
Element.getElementsByTagName has a similar conflict which is addressed 
by patching the spec to make them identical.  I may need to do a similar 
hack but it would be good if the conflict could eventually be eliminated.
