Hi:
  DOM L3 LS CR spec at 
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-DOM-Level-3-LS-20031107/load-save.html 
contain a small mistake in the description of LSWriter

 It currently says

*Type Definition /LSWriter/*

    A |LSWriter|
    <http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-DOM-Level-3-LS-20031107/load-save.html#LSWriter>
    represents a character stream for the XML input.          

 But it should say that "A LSWriter represents a character stream for 
the XML output"  instead of XML input

Regards
-Ramesh
