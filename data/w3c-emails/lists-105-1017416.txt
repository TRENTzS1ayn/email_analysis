This is true from my point of view but not really usefull, just as you said.

Well, a blind spec implemented (damn, just like me) would provide the behavior 
just as the spec acutally specifies, but I now intent to raise a DOMException 
of type HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR since this is really a hierarchy request error.

However, ignoring the methods function is really not the best behavior as the 
currently supporting browsers do so :(

I propose to clarify this as I said above.
