Sure it is. For example, the element in '<a xmlns="a"/>' has a non-null
namespaceURI but no prefix. It must be possible to create the element by
DOM methods without having to create the namespace declaration attribute.

Up until DOM Level 3, there was nothing to say how (if at all) namespace
fixup should be done in this case. This is better defined in the latest
specs (dependent on the value of the 'namespaces' parameter to
DOMConfiguration, an imp might be expected to do the fixup on serialisation
and/or normalisation), with a suggested algorithm, so imps should hopefully
become more standardised on this issue.
