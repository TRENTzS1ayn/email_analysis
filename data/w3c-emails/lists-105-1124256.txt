Ah! I see what you mean properly now. :-)

As I read it, the prefix of an Attr node is, in the face of namespace
normalisation, not fixed, so it makes sense that a non-namespace-well-formed
situation (namespace w/ null prefix) should be allowed to exist temporarily
- it could be used by authors to create attributes in a namespace without
caring what prefix will later be used in the serialisation.

My interpretation, anyway.
