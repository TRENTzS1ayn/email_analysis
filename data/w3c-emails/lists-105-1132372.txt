Yes, I agree that having the prefix as an indication of what the author 
would like to see used that may eventually be something different (if 
two attributes with the same prefix but different namespaces are set on 
the same element) or that may be absent to let the implementation make a 
reasonable choice is a good feature. But as you say, the text around the 
method more or less leaves that up to interpretation, having it spelt 
out would be nicer and more conducive to interoperable implementations.
