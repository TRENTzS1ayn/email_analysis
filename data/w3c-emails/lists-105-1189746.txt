I've logged bug 444 (http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=444) 
to the DOM TS to address the issues that were raised in this thread.  
The existing L2 Core tests elementsetattributens01 and 03 appeared to 
cover using a non-null namespace and a non-prefixed qualified name in 
memory on a call to Element.setAttributeNS.  I added DOMWriterTest5 and 
6 to check serialization of attributes added in this manner.
