Current version of Load and Save spec. does not allow setting namespaces to
false during serialization.
This means DOM Level 1 trees are not serializable with LS spec. and I am
aware of several Xerces users who wanted to turn off namespaces during
serialization since they still have DOM Level 1 trees and don't want to
*see* extra errors nor extra namespace attributes added (during namespace
fixup).

Same should apply to namespace-declaration parameter.

Thank you,
