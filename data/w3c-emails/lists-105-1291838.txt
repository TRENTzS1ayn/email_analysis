Hi,

The file DOM2-Core.zip is missing two files referenced by 
"part-entities.xml" and "dom-spec.xml". Is it planned to included them 
someday or are they expected to be created manually. Obviously this is a 
known fact, since the Ant file "build.xml" for the DOM Test-Suite 
recreates those files:

<!--  zip file is missing two support files   -->
<echo file="${specs.dir}/Level-2/xml/options.xml"
   message="&lt;?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?&gt;"/>
<echo file="${specs.dir}/Level-2/xml/status.xml"
   message="&lt;?xml version='1.0'  encoding='UTF-8'?&gt;"/>


Regards,

Kasimier
