Those should not be necessary. The zip file contains only one
xml-source.xml file with the entire XML source for the Core spec.

I don't know why the DOM Test Suite recreates them (probably for
historical reasons since the XML source used to be delivered using
several separated files instead of only one)  but there is no need to
have included with the zip file of the specification.
