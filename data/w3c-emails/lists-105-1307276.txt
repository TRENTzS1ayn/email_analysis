The file "xml-source.xml" does exist in the "DOM3-Core.zip" file, but 
not in the "DOM2-Core.zip" file [1].

Hmm, I tried to imitate the build process for the DOM level 2 tests 
defined in "build.xml", where the "dom2-core-interfaces.xml" is created 
using "dom-spec.xml". Having read your statement I wonder if this is the 
proper way; so I need clarification of the following: is it accurate to 
use the DOM level 3 specification for building DOM level 2 (or level 1) 
tests (I.e. to build "interfaces.xml" and the DTDs)?
