When XPath ran into similar issues -- specifically, when they wanted to
consider an element the parent of its attributes, despite their not being
children -- the DOM's response was that, while we were willing to given
them an ownerElement attribute on Attrs so this navigation was possible, we
were not willing to accept and implement their definition of parent; it was
their responsibility to write their implementation of XPath's parent
operation so that when run over a DOM it Did The Right Thing.

Frankly, I think the response to SVG's request should be similar. There's
nothing wrong with a firstNonTextChild operation being provided by the SVG
abstract data model. But I don't see any strong reason it has to be a
property of the DOM Node, rather than an operation provided by SVG which
may be applied to a DOM Node.
