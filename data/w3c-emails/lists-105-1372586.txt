I believe that this is a different kind of issue though. Given 
ownerElement one has all it takes to do XPath's parent axis right. 
Without the chapter/addition we propose, one cannot produce a useful 
Mobile DOM subset for the devices we are targeting.

We are not investigating /direct/ additions to dom::Element -- as I've 
said that is unfortunately impossible at this time -- but rather a new 
chapter in the DOM suite (and the ability to file this under org.w3.dom).

Having an SVG-specific method does nothing at all to solve the issue of 
a Mobile DOM subset applicable to multinamespace documents. Despite this 
work being undertaken by the SVG WG, that is what we need.
