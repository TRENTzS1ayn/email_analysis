The XML Protocol Working Group would like to bring one of its work 
items, XML-binary Optimized Packaging (XOP) [1] to the attention of the 
DOM Working Group.

XOP is an alternate serialization of XML that provides Infoset 
fidelity, while making it possible to gain efficiencies when 
base64-encoded content is present in elements.

In particular, although the content is conceptually base64-encoded 
(i.e., it shows up as such in an Infoset abstraction), it is in fact 
binary data when serialized; a MIME multipart package contains the XML 
with references out to the binary data in attachments.

However, to enable applications to obtain the full benefit of the this 
serialization, it is necessary for slight changes to existing APIs, so 
that they can access the raw binary stream, rather than the character 
representation of it.

Because of this, the XML Protocol Working Group would like the DOM WG 
(or IG) to consider how this might be accommodated in DOM. We would be 
glad to discuss the use cases, practical considerations, etc. with you, 
at your convenience.

We would also appreciate any feedback, as we anticipate being in Last 
Call soon.
