DOM Level 2 HTML also does not deal with XML. It's the DOM all the same. 
SMIL and SVG DOMs have non-XML features, yet they integrate well, 
strongly, and usefully with the Core DOM. If that's pollution, it would 
seem we are much polluted already, and people are liking it.

Amongst the clever things DOM 3 Core adds is DOM Features[0]. If one 
were to develop a supplemental DOM chapter that would add support for 
the direct retrieval of binary data, and define a feature string for it, 
then with no modification to the Core DOM implementations could 
nevertheless support XOP, and make it cleanly available to users.

That would be something for XMLP to develop though, but I reckon it 
wouldn't require much of their time.
