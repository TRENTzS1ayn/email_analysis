Those work by subclassing the existing DOM interfaces. I read this 
proposal to be requesting modifications to the core of DOM, a very 
different thing. If that's not the case, and they just want to 
subclass, then why do they need support for the DOM Core group 
instead of doing it themselves as the SVG and SMIL groups have done?

However, SMIL and SVG are XML. XOP is not. I really question whether 
trying to present XOP as XML is the right path, especially since they 
seem to find it onerous to use the existing APIs for processing XML.

HTML is not XML (though XHTML is) and this is partly responsible for 
the mess that is DOM. And people do not like it. In fact, I would say 
that web developers who have to deal with HTML DOMs are even less 
fond of the DOM than XML developers are.

Perhaps. I suspect that would not satisfy the requestors though. In 
particular I think they would object to having to create element 
nodes for their xop:include elements.
