XML allows base64-encoded content; indeed, this is a practice that is 
encouraged by other recommendation-level W3C specifications. Is it too 
difficult to believe that people creating or consuming documents 
containing such content might actually want to work with the binary 
data instead of its encoded form? I would think that use cases for such 
data that explicitly focus on the encoded form are by far in the 
minority (Digital Signature is the only significant one that comes to 
mind immediately).
