 I'm with Eliotte here. Either subclass or simply make a new API set,
it doesn't have to be pushed to the DOM level. If you are not handling
Markup based structures then use another API, maybe it already exists
maybe not, but in the later case it's not a reason to push it in DOM
which is already complex enough.
