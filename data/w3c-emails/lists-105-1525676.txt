 From my viewpoint (i.e., not representing the WG), the focus of the 
request wasn't to "push" a particular way to support this onto DOM; 
rather, to solicit feedback from DOM about how it would be best 
accommodated. Based on the discussion so far, subclassing seems to be a 
good approach, but it sounds likely that it would need to be done by a 
WG other than DOM.
