  Okay, that sounds reasonable, subclassing is fine. My main worry
is that DOM is already considered complex, and has a lot of different
extensions. The only thing more or less clear to users is that it is
an API to process parsed markup languages, and it's probably better
to avoid using the "DOM" name for anything which is not strongly tied
to markup.
