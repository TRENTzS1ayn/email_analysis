/ Philippe Le Hegaret <plh@w3.org> was heard to say:
| Here are the comments from the DOM Working Group regarding the
| XQuery/XPath Data Model document [1].
[...]
| Finally, the DOM Working Group reiterates his previous comment (DOM8)
| regarding the name conflict between the accessor dm:node-name and the
| DOM attribute Node.nodeName. Again, the notion of node names between DOM
| and the XQuery/XPath Data Model is significantly different, even if the
| XQuery/XPath specification does not call for physical implementation of
| the abstract model. A different name (dm:universal-name, or
| dm:node-uname, etc.) should be used to avoid conflict and confusion,
| such as the ones reported in September 2000 [3].

The WG has discussed this issue and decided that no change is
necessary. We note, in particular, that our node-name function is in a
different namespace which is an accepted method for providing globally
unique names. There was no support in the WGs for renaming our
accessor.

We also point out that the node-name function exists in F&O and that
the node-name accessor provides the abstract functionality required for
this user-visible function.
