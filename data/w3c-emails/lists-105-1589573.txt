They are converted to plain characters and included in Text nodes as if 
the characters were included directly. (The in-built entity references 
such as &amp; do the same.)

Yes, the Unicode character for that phoneme. By spec, DOM 
implementations must use a character set that supports Unicode.

They shouldn't, normally, for UTF-8 and other encodings capable of 
reproducing the entire Unicode repertoire. Numerical character 
references should come out when you try to serialise your document 
containing an IPA character to an encoding that doesn't support IPA 
characters, for example ISO-8859-1 or US-ASCII.
