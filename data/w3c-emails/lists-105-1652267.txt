I'd like comments on this if anyone has thought this through.  Assume 
that you have an implementation that supports Core on generic XML 
documents and application specific DOM, such as L2 HTML, SVG or MathML.  
If you automatically created the application specific elements when you 
encounted recognized elements, you may incur additional overhead in DOM 
building and may reject documents that are valid XML but aren't valid 
XHTML or SVG.  However, if you don't automatically do that, you always 
get a generic DOM implementation.  I think that doing this right would 
require an additional configuration parameter in LSParser, but I haven't 
thought through what that would look like.
