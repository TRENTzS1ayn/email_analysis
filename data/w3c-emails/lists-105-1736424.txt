The definition of qualified name, according the DOM glossary:
[[
A qualified name is the name of an element or attribute defined as the
concatenation of a local name (as defined in this specification),
optionally preceded by a namespace prefix and colon character.
]]
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-DOM-Level-3-Core-20031107/glossary.html#dt-qualifiedname

A qName may therefore contain a prefix when used with setAttributeNS().

Your case is a serialization issue. DOM Level 3 Core doesn't say
anything about the serialization of a DOM tree but it does have an
algorithm to do namespace fix-up, which is also used by the LSSerializer
of DOM Level 3 Load and Save, to deal with your case:
[[
if ( Attr[i] has a namespace URI )
     {
        if ( attribute has no prefix (default namespace decl does not apply to attributes) 
             OR [...])
        {              
           if (namespaceURI matches an in scope declaration of one or more prefixes) 
           {
               // pick the most local binding available; 
               // if there is more than one pick one arbitrarily

               ==> change attribute's prefix.
           }
           else 
           {
               if (the current prefix is not null and it has no in scope declaration) 
               {
                   ==> declare this prefix
               } 
               else 
               {
                   // find a prefix following the pattern "NS" +index (starting at 1)
                   // make sure this prefix is not declared in the current scope.
                   // create a local namespace declaration attribute

                   ==> change attribute's prefix.
               }
           }           
        }
]]
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-DOM-Level-3-Core-20031107/namespaces-algorithms.html

In other words, it is not an error, and a new prefix will be generated
and declared by the implementation if necessary.
