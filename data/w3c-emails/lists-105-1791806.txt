First, the documentation is written from the point of view of the
specification, not from the javadoc. The javadoc is generated as a
convenience in the Java interfaces, but the DOM script that generates
the interface cannot produces different text for each setter and getter
in the Javadoc.

The CR version of the specification does say:
[[
The default value for this attribute is null.
]]
http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/CR-DOM-Level-3-LS-20031107/load-save.html#LS-LSSerializer-newLine

Generated automatically from the specification. It is the case for all
DOM attributes.

Doing so would require changing the way the specification is being
produced (using xmlspec for the moment). I can try to write the text so
that it is comprehensible when you read from a setNewLine() or
getNewLine() javadoc point of view but making the attribute texts
specific for their setter and their getter would require more work than
I am willing to spend on it now. Core and LS contain 100 attributes.

Agreed. We changed the description to get the default value
(implementation specific end-of-line sequence) on retrieval, and on
setting,  use the value null to set it to its default value.
