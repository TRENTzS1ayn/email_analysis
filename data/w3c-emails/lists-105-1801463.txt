Fixed.

It's already in the implementations now. No reason to change this, so no
change.

I added a direct link to DOMConfiguration.

Correct. Added no-input-specified error.

The sentence was removed from the LSResourceResolver description.

s/.../e.g. the target namespace of the XML Schema/. The "namespace of
the resource" is resource dependent and should be used a parameter of
the resource being resolved.

Changed. now it does.

I can be used to load XHTML documents, but we never intended the
interfaces for HTML documents.

Fixed.

It was clarified as follows:
[[
method on the filter. If the parameter "entities" is set to true, the
entity reference nodes are passed to the filter, but not its children.
If it is set to false, the children of the entity reference are passed
to the filter, but not the entity reference nodes since they are
replaced by their expansions. Note that, as described by the parameter
"entities", entity reference nodes to non-defined entities are always
passed to the filter.
]]

Yes. the output stream could be attached to an HTTP connection. No
changes were made in the specification.

correct, "unless 'entities' parameter is set to false. As long as the
children of the entity reference are defined, you won't get an entity
reference node in the serialized content.

This issue left in the specification for the attention of the
implementators. We clarified that yes, the transformation done during
the serilization do not affect the DOM tree, only the serialized
content.

Regarding namespaces and namespaces-declarations, it has been clarified
that:
- namespaces can be set to false on LSSerializer.domConfig.
- namespace-declarations has effect if namespaces is set to false.
(since no namespace processing is done, the xmlns attributes are no
longer namespace declarations).

Regarding well-formed, this discussion is still on-going.

The sentence was removed. It has been pointed out that this attribute
can (and should) have an effect.
