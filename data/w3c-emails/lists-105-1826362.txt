Xerces is just an illustrative case. We can't contact every possible Xerces
user; we can't contact everyone who has ever implemented a DOM.

If they met the spec as it was written, they're compliant, even if the way
they met it isn't the way you'd prefer. Some things really were left as
quality-of-implementation and flexibility-for-performance-tuning issues.

So what you're proposing here is an erratum against DOM Level 1. Errata
have a pretty high activation energy barrier to jump over or tunnel through
before they can be approved; "it might be nice" or "we would have done it
that way if we'd thought of it" generally don't do it. I think this one's
going to fall into the latter category, but good luck...
