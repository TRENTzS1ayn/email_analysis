I was tranliterating some getFeature from L&S to validation and stumbed 
onto this case:

boolean state = domImpl.getFeature("Validation", "3.0");

Validation does not introduce a specialized interface for DOM 
implementations (neither does Events) and the spec does not give 
explicit guidance to the expected return value.  My instinct is that it 
should be null.  The wording for DOMImplementation could be:

Returns an object which implements the specialized APIs of the specified 
feature and version, if any, or null if there is no object which 
implements interfaces associated with that feature
+ or the feature does not define a specialization of DOMImplementation.
