I'm not sure this entirely answers Sander's query as I understood it.
Certainly I'd like to know:

  What happens when "entities" is set to true and the LS...Filter asks for
  the entity reference node to be SKIPped?

  1. the child nodes are processed with the filter receiving callbacks for
     them, as if "entities" had been set to false just for this one entity
     reference;
  2. the entity reference's child nodes are processed en bloc, without
     calling the filter again at all;
  3. it is taken as the equivalent of REJECTing the entity reference, so
     nothing is processed;
  4. explicitly disallowed;
  5. implementation specific.

(FWIW, pxdom currently plumps for option 1.)
