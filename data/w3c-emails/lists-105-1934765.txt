Test documentadoptnode28 (unintentionally?) adopts a node into its 
current document.  Allowing this case seems undesirable, at best it acts 
as node.parentNode.removeChild(node), actual behavior could be much 
worse.  Would it be possible to state that WRONG_DOCUMENT_ERR should be 
thrown on attempt to adopt a node into the same document?
