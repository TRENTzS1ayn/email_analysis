I'm not convinced that this is a Good Idea. It turns a mostly-harmless
operation into an error condition, and prevents adoptNode from being used
as a general safety net prior to insertion of a node obtained from an
untrusted source.

Making adopting a node into its own document be a no-op would seem to be a
cleaner fix for Curt's concern about the side-effect... though leaving it
as it now stands also strikes me as acceptable.
