As an alternative to "other node", we could also consider "parameter node"
or "node passed as a parameter"... a bit more verbose but avoids any
question about the intent.

(I'd almost be tempted to render "this" in boldface when we're using it as
a keyword to signify the-node-which-is-performing-the-operation, but I
don't think I can see the WG on that idea.)
