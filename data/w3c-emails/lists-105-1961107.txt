Couldn't the name of the parameter be used?  This seems an easy way to
keep the text both simple and clear.

Ugh.  It would have to be defined somewhere as well; not all languages
prefer "this" as the name for the object on which the method is being
called.  (Of course, I don't know of any really good way to refer to
that object with having a defined keyword of some sort in the text.)
