On my way to a question related to the default error handler, I found
that one:

See the note in the ECMAScript binding:

[[
Note: In addition of having DOMConfiguration parameters exposed to the
application using the setParameter and getParameter, those parameters
are also exposed as ECMAScript properties on the DOMConfiguration
object. The name of the parameter is converted into a property name
using a camel-case convention: the character '-' (HYPHEN-MINUS) is
removed and the following character is being replaced by its uppercase
equivalent.

It is indeed a good point...
