Ian,

given the differences between the implementations (at least 2 known
implementations would be broken if the specification was updated
following your proposal), the group decided not to reopen this issue and
leave it as "implementation dependent".

We will therefore report this issue as objection [1] to the Director
when reviewing the issues list,

Philippe
