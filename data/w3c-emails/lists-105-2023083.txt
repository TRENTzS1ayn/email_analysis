We reconsidered our change and change the specification as follows for
DataUserHandler, LSParserFilter, and LSSerializerFilter:
[[
DOM applications must not raised exceptions in a filter. The effect of
throwing exceptions from a filter is DOM implementation dependent.
]

(modulo, for the data handler, s/filter/data handler/)

Let us know if this satisfy your original comment.
