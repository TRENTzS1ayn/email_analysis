Okay, thank you for the change.

I hereby agree with your responses for
ls-sander-1 through ls-sander-11
of http://www.w3.org/2003/12/22-dom-core-issues/issues.html,
with for ls-sander-9 the assumption that if well-formed remains in the
specification, it will be possible to set it to false for a serializer.

Kind regards,

--Sander.
