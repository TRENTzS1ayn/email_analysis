Hi,

I'm trying to implement the method LSSerializer.writeToString and would 
like to know what encoding declaration should be written if serializing 
the document node. Should it always be "UTF-16", or should it be the 
current xmlEncoding (e.g. ISO-8859-1)? What about if the DOMString is 
UTF-16LE encoded, as in our implementation: should it always be "UTF-16" 
or "UTF-16LE" in this case?

Any hints? I did not find any explicit information. The specs say: "this 
method completely ignores all the encoding information available", but 
I'm not sure about what this really means.

Please write to me directly, because I'm not on this mailing list 
currently, since I get no response if subscribing with 
"www-dom-request@w3.org" on my current account.

Thanks in advance,

Kasimier
