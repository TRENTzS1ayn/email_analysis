Hi,

I'm trying to implement the method LSSerializer.writeToString and would 
like to know what encoding declaration should be written if serializing 
the document node. Should it always be "UTF-16", or should it be the 
current xmlEncoding (e.g. ISO-8859-1)? What about if the DOMString is 
UTF-16LE encoded, as in our implementation: should it always be "UTF-16" 
or "UTF-16LE" in this case?

Any hints? I did not find any explicit information. The specs say: "this 
method completely ignores all the encoding information available", but 
I'm not sure about what this really means.

NOTE: After 2 months (!) of efforts to subscribe to this list, I 
received the first mail from the list (2004-01-28). Since it is the only 
one I received until now, I'm not sure if everything's working well: is 
there simply not much traffic (I really did not expect that!), or does 
the list have problems dispatching mails?


Thanks in advance,

Kasimier Buchcik
