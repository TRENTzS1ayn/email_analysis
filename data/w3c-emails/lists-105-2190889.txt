I need to generate XML that adheres to the standard.

Most of the solutions that I've seen suggested employ individual .appendchild calls.  Text in those calls contains all the necessary XML characters. 
This method implies that a user is already intimately familiar with the XML standard and knows how to format a DOM document that adheres to that standard.
Is this really the way all these applications out there generate their XML documents or is there a tool that will do it.  I find no functionality in Xerces that will take some form of data input, other than pseudo xml, and turn it into an XML document.
