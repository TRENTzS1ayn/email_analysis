The sentence in the previous paragraph:

# The terms "UTF-8" and "UTF-16" in this specification do not apply to
# character encodings with any other labels, even if the encodings or
# labels are very similar to UTF-8 or UTF-16.

is intended to cover UTF-16BE and UTF-16LE, as well as CESU-8.  Only the
encodings actually named "UTF-16" and "UTF-8" are allowed without an
encoding declaration, and the "UTF-16" encoding actually requires a BOM
in XML, though not in plain text generally.

After all, the whole point of the encodings "UTF-16BE" and "UTF-16LE"
is that they MUST NOT begin with a BOM: if the first two bytes are 0xFE
0xFF or 0xFF 0xFE, that represents a U+FEFF character, and if document
is not well formed.

Trust me on this one.  I was there.  :-)
