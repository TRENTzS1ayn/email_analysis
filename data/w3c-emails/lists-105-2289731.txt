Special thanks to IBM, Oracle, and X-Hive for their implementations and
providing the results of the tests. Many thanks to Andrew, Curt, and
Sander for their comments.

Ramesh, I didn't resolve your Javadoc problem [1] unfortunately and I
don't think this is a solvable problem with the current XML source of
the specifications. I welcome ideas in any case.

As usual, send your comments on this list,

Regards,

Philippe
