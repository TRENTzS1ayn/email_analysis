That would be certainly nice but I don't think that someone is willing
to take the entire document and search for those. Document and
DOMImplementation are not linked because there are part of the Core and
the scripts don't generate automatic link between DOM modules.

Fixed.

Yes. The sentence you mentioned is just after the table of contents and
before the sub sections. I don't think changes are needed.

DOM specifications never used the RFC 2119 explicitly and this is
unfortunate The Manual of Style was published a long time after the
publication of the publication of DOM Level 2.

The conformance section for DOM Level 3 modules is included in the
introduction of DOM Level 3 Core, as noted in the introduction of
section 1.3. There is no need to repeat it across all DOM Modules.

done.

Not done, since a complete document is not a fragment. I kept the
current wording.
