 From  
http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/PR-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040205/core#parameter- 
check-character-normalization

"check-character-normalization"
true
[optional]
  Check if the characters in the document are fully normalized,  as  
defined in appendix B of [XML 1.1].

What actions should be expected if a character in the document is not  
fully normalized?  I'd assume that an error should be dispatched, but  
the spec doesn't say.

What should be the behavior if both check-character-normalization and  
normalize-characters are specified as true?  Are there any interaction  
between the parameters?  It might make sense that setting one unsets  
the other.

As far as I am aware there are no implementations supporting either of  
these parameter being true.
