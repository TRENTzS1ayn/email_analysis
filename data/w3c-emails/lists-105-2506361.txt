Actually, the description of the parameter in the Core specification is
correct. Setting validate to false does not do schema processing at all,
i.e. it does nothing.
However, you do have a point that this behavior is against the XML
specification for the Load module. Therefore the Load must refines the
definition of validate false to mention that internal subset processing
is always accomplished.
