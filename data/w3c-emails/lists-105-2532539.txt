This is correct. DOM Level 1 applications need to be careful about this
before invoking a load, parse, or normalizeDocument methods.

We still believe that it is dangerous to mix non-namespaces and
namespaces aware nodes in the same tree. This reflects a design problem
in the DOM application.

The default processing may not cause the processing to stop if the error
can be recovered (cf [1]). Continuing the processing if the mistake
cannot be recovered would be harmful if the document is being serialized
for example.

As mentioned in the section regarding XML Namespaces (1.3.3), this
behavior should be avoided.

If the processor believes that the error can be recovered, it is free to
continue the processing.
