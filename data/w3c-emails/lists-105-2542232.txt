Hello,

Minor comments for DOM 3 Core [1].

s/DOM Working Group members/DOM Working Group participants/
s/throught/through/

Tables would be easier to read (I think) with cellpadding="3" or so.

The first occurrence of [in-scope namespaces] needs b markup.

Harder to do maybe, but perhaps with some exceptions, headings and the
TOCs could be capitalized like US English (for example, Normative
References). If there is a reason Binding has a cap and interface doesn't
then please ignore this comment.

Best wishes for your project,
