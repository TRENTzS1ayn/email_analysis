I would propose null as a return value.

I don't think it should be an error, at most a warning. HTTP is allowed
to overwrite the encoding of the XML declaration already. I would treat
it the same for this case: the information in the XML declaration is
overwritten by the encoding of DOMString, and is therefore simply
ignored.
