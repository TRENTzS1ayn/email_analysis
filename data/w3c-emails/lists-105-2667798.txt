Currently, Xerces-J will interpret an empty features list as "no 
features required" and will return the first available implementation 
for getDOMImplementation and every available implementation for 
getDOMImplementationList.  I believe that behavior is consistent with 
the spec.  If you start out with a long features list on a call to 
getDOMImplementationList and start removing features, you will always 
get the same or larger set of implementations.  It would be 
inconsistent that removing the last feature would clear the list.  I've 
got two tests on tap (one each for getDOMImplementation and 
getDOMImplementationList) that I'll commit to the test suite unless 
there are any objections.
