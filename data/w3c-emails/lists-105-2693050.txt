I would recommend reading a tutorial on DOM.  Almost any good 
introductory XML book should have one.  There are also many on the web, 
see http://xmlfiles.com/dom/, http://www.xml.com/pub/rg/141, 
http://java.sun.com/webservices/docs/1.0/tutorial/doc/JAXPDOM.html   
General question on usage should be directed to the users mailing list 
associated with your DOM implementation of choice, for example, 
xerces-j-users@xml.apache.org.

If you implementing the DOM for a class assignment, you should 
investigate using the DOM Test Suite (http://www.w3.org/DOM/Test) to 
check your interpretation of the specification.  If you are 
implementing the DOM and it is not for a class assignment, then you 
might want to reconsider since there are no shortage of existing 
implementations for common programming languages and platforms.
