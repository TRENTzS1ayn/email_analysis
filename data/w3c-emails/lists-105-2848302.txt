Hi!

I just popped over to the registration area for the workshop and was a bit
frustrated by the selection of topics for our areas of interest. Minimally,
I would suggest that the list include:

* rights management technology development (not simply "software")
* rights management services (including clearinghouse services)
* privacy-enhancing technology and services
* distributed trust technologies & services
* research in rights management-related technologies

* content deployment
* content licensing or sales
* content creation
* rights owner
* rights broker
* library
