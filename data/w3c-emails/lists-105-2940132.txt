Dear Workshop Organizers:

I, Hiroshi Kawamura of JSRPD is going to attend the workshop on behalf of
the DAISY Consortium.  The position paper has been submitted by George
Kerscher.
The registration form on the w3c website

http://cgi.w3.org/Register/selectUser.pl?_w3c_meetingName=WSDRMJan2001

 seems not working for me.

Could you please send me the form as an attachment file to my e-mail.

Thank you very much in advance.

Hiroshi
