Dear all, 

there are a lot of initiatives out there. I would mention also
ODRML, which was developed by IPR-Systems. MPEG is also
addressing the question, as one can see from the minutes of the
workshop held in Sophia Antipolis in January. 

There was also Brad Gandee from ContentGuard. As you can see on
www.xrml.org, xrml is owned by Contentguard. 

We'll have the summary report ready soon and there will be the
Adivisory Committee Meeting in Honkong next week. Afterwards, I
hope, I can tell you more. 

From my response, you can already see, that there is no
recommendation from W3C in this area until now. (Except perhaps
the Micropayments - Specification and P3P)

So I can't answer with yes. 

Best,
