I think, what he means, is that there are many attempts out there
to solve the same problem. Most of those attempts use a given
semantics within angle brackets(XML). 

Renato suggested to use RDF, which is also with angle-brackets,
but has more constraints than pure XML.

But I agree, that it is funny to see the multiplication of
efforts, while in the workshop there were already voices
complaining about too many different initiatives, which are hard
to coordinate. 

Best, 

Rigo
