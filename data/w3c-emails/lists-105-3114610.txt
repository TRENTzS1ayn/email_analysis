Not exactly...for ODRL [1] we use just plain XML (via a DTD)
and the next version will heavily use XML Schemas [2].

I think this was one of the reasons for the W3C DRM Workshop
in the first place. There seems to be a number of initiatives
started recently. I don't think that it is too late for
coordination across these groups. In fact, the ones that I am
involved with are all-to-happy to see coordination.
DRM is a big problem to solve - we actually need a number
of groups solving all the "pieces" of the framework...
