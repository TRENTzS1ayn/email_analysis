Agreed.
In fact, the OeBF has the duplication/coordination issue high on the agenda
of all Working Groups.  Both MPEG and this list are well represented in the
OeBF discussions, so I believe that we will see a significant amount of
progress.

Good point. As far as coordination is concerned, MPEG is
very open to that (with W3C, but also IETF and OEBF with which
there is a liaison). The January Workshop invitation still stands.

I think, what he means, is that there are many attempts out there
to solve the same problem. Most of those attempts use a given
semantics within angle brackets(XML).

Renato suggested to use RDF, which is also with angle-brackets,
but has more constraints than pure XML.

But I agree, that it is funny to see the multiplication of
efforts, while in the workshop there were already voices
complaining about too many different initiatives, which are hard
to coordinate.

Best,

Rigo
