Dear Renato and others,

Thanks for your reply. I have several questions:

1. Is ODPL recognized by standard organization? and which
   standard? such as W3C?

2. Are there any tools (such as words viewer, media player
   etc) that support ODPL in the market now?

3. Are there any SDK or API for ODPL???

4. What do you think about XrML??

Thanks.
