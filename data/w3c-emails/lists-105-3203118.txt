You will note from the Press Release from OASIS that Reuters is one of
the initial members of the OASIS XACML Technical Committee.  I will be
taking part in the kick-off teleconference on 12 May and would hope
that any work undertaken by OASIS will be aligned as closely as
possible to the many other efforts currently in the process of
starting up.  I am fearful that too many competing standards will have
the following effects:

1/ to dilute the effort applied in any one place
2/ to spread too thin the efforts of those who are trying to keep
     up with (i.e., by active participation) multiple standards
3/ to reduce the likelihood of truly interoperable systems
4/ to impact credibility

Looking at the PKI space, one sees many standards in place (PKIX,
OCSP, PKCS, S/MIME, etc) but each of those is operating in a slightly
different problem domain.  My concern about the rights management
standards is that there is significant overlap.  I would be looking,
ideally, for niches to be identified in which the different standards
excel and which are complementary.  Clearly, lines of responsibility
need to be drawn.

Regards,
/Dave.

Subject: [Moderator Action] XACML - Extensible Access Control Markup Language

Hi,

I worked at Intertrust for some years, and so am familiar with DRM concepts. I
note XACML, which was begun at IBM and announced today by OASIS as a technical
committee, as another form of XML-based rights language, growing out of
enterprise access control practices:
http://xml.coverpages.org/XACML-PR20010424.html. The XACML web page:
http://xml.coverpages.org/xacl.html.

>From the press release:
"XACML will define the representation for rules that specify the who, what, when
and how of information access," explained Simon Y. Blackwell of Psoom, chair of
the OASIS XACML Technical Committee. "Access control, which is often called
'rights management' or 'entitlement management,' determines who can look at
something, what they can do with it, the type of device they can look at it on,
etc."

I'd appreciate hearing how this effort might fit in.

Larry Gussin
