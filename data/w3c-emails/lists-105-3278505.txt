Dear J Chong.

Follows are my private opinion.

ODRL is a royalty-free and license-free rights language, but XrML is a royalty-free and license-request rights language.
In case of W3C, all specifications of the party do not require the royalty and license to use. Everyone can freely use them.
But  MPEG doesn't concern with the problems, related with license and royalty.

The meaning of the standard is recommended by the communities, like W3C, MPEG, ...
Currently, it doesn't exist the standard rights languages.

Under the these situations, 
I think the first concept of W3C is very similar with ODRL structure. It is from the situation, like royalty-free and license-free.
But ORDL and XrML can propose to MPEG-21, because he doesn't concern with the problems.

I think that there is no public API for the rights languages. 
MS WMT freely provides API for DRM service system, but I don't know it exactly follows XrML spec.
The usage rules of the WMT are different from XrML.

There is no public API for the pubic rights langauges, like ODRL and XrML.
I think a few companies may have the API for the rights languages.

If MPEG or W3C will develop the rights language, they may define the API protocol following the rights language.
If you want to acquire API and standard rights language, we continously follow-up MPEG-21 and W3C.

Dear Renato and others

Thanks for your reply.  I have one more question, do you know
whether there is a standard rights language and also do you know whether
there are SDK or API for particular rights language now? 

Thanks.
