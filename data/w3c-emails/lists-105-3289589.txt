1. 
The meanings of the license is to permit to use it.
Then meanings of the royalty is to compensate to your usages. Simply to speak, you pay money to use it.

2. It is out of my scope. There is no any thing to be decided currently.

Dear ChangYeol LEE

Thank you very much for your reply. Could you please help me to
clear up my confusion.

1. What is royalty-free and license-free?
2. From your email, feels like you think that ODPL is preferred by
   W3C as the standard rights language?

Thousand thanks. Wish you all the best.
