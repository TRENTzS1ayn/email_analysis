Larry makes some very interesting points.  On the subject of any
distinction between XACML and other rights management initiatives in
terms of scope and applicability I would say the following.  A good
number of companies have for many years been in the business of
defining access controls, contractual relationships, intellectual
property boundaries, security mechanisms for distribution channels
(legal and technical), and so on.  The current, fairly widely scoped
aims of certain rights and obligations management initiatives gives us
the opportunity to unite these activities in a mutually compatible set
of machine-processable languages.  The benefits of doing so are
enormous.  If, at this stage, we allow mutual incompatibilities
between standards to evolve, because they are operating in slightly
different, but overlapping spaces then the opportunity is lost.  One
way to achieve compatibility is to encourage cross-standards
participation, awareness, and discussion.  Only time will tell whether
this is achievable.

Regards,
/Dave.
