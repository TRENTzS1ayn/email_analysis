DRM Workshop colleagues,

It seems we were among the first to hold a DRM forum...  The IBC is the
equivalent in Europe of the NAB in the US ... the Broadcast Industry.
Perhaps we, and MPEG as well I think, should be represented at this event.
It falls one week before the July MPEG meeting now scheduled for Sydney the
week of 16 July.
