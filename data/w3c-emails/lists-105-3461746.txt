I agree with John.  IBC is one of several purely commercial conference/event
organisers who have picked up the DRM issue as an item of importance
(another one which has been doing this recently is IQPC, and I think RBI.
That's fine, and their success in attracting audiences (typically 20-50)
shows their meetings have a place.  But they serve a rather different
audience, and have a different aim, to the sort of discussion we got into in
Sophia.  They have no standards formation role, or follow through
activities.  These general conferences do not get into the meat of the
issue. In my experience, having spoken at several of them, they tend to
operate at the level of talks on "why do I need to manage content".  Getting
into details of ontology, rights expression languages, etc, is not what they
are about.

At the risk of sounding arrogant...

It is not clear to me whether or not the conference referred to (below)
would be an appropriate forum for the level of discussion we would like to
have. I worry that much of what we focused on in Nice, and presumably would
like to focus on in future forums, would be lost on this audience (but I
don't know for sure).

When it comes to rights management conferences and forums, we really must
try to "separate the wheat from the chaff." I've participated in and/or have
chaired a few over the last year or so, and they almost always turn out to
be marketing events --- opportunities for vendors to display their wares to
publishers, etc, etc.

The W3C DRM Workshop was the first rights management event I've been at
since the mid-90's that even approached what I would like to see in terms of
(a) hard-core, open technical presentations and (b) real-live, working
sessions. We need to search for and/or create a whole new type of forum for
the rights management sector, in which open interchanges contribute at
fundamental levels to interoperability, standardization and (in general)
better understanding of the sector.

Just a few thoughts!
