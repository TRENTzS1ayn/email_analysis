John, all,

I guess I have been bitten by alphabet soup... The IBC in the note I
forwarded is not the IBC I thought it was nonetheless ...  it provides
information on potential participants to the W3C DRM workgroup where we
would plan to do the real work of developing policy and specifications.

At the risk of sounding arrogant...

It is not clear to me whether or not the conference referred to (below)
would be an appropriate forum for the level of discussion we would like to
have. I worry that much of what we focused on in Nice, and presumably would
like to focus on in future forums, would be lost on this audience (but I
don't know for sure).

When it comes to rights management conferences and forums, we really must
try to "separate the wheat from the chaff." I've participated in and/or
have
chaired a few over the last year or so, and they almost always turn out to
be marketing events --- opportunities for vendors to display their wares to
publishers, etc, etc.

The W3C DRM Workshop was the first rights management event I've been at
since the mid-90's that even approached what I would like to see in terms
of
(a) hard-core, open technical presentations and (b) real-live, working
sessions. We need to search for and/or create a whole new type of forum for
the rights management sector, in which open interchanges contribute at
fundamental levels to interoperability, standardization and (in general)
better understanding of the sector.

Just a few thoughts!
