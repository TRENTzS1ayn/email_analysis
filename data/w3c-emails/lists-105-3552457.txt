I've attached a working document with reflections on the Workshop, exploring
several  issues and proposing next steps. The Program Committee has seen an
earlier version of this; it is evolving, and includes thoughts on some of
the discussions this morning (including some of the points Jonathan just
raised...)

My intent is to evolve our discussions toward a something that would
resemble a "plan" or draft of an Activity Proposal, consistent with the
goals and process of the W3C. I would appreciate comments, suggestions,
criticism, etc!
