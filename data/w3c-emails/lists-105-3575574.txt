Tom,

Thank you for the feedback... I keep getting conflicting information. I
have had claims that they are one in the same IBC  but after checking out
your web site info you appear to be correct... they are separate
organizations....arrgghhh alphabet soup

There are two IBCs.  The one that you mention (normally a September event)
and the other IBC which holds conferences all year round.  As far as I can
tell they have no relation to each other.

I looked at the "other" IBC site http://www.ibctelecoms.com/ but can't find
this particular conference listed yet.  I then checked the "Broadcast" IBC
at http://www.ibc.org.uk/ and could only find reference to the September
event.

Perhaps Daniel can help clarify this for us.

DRM Workshop colleagues,

It seems we were among the first to hold a DRM forum...  The IBC is the
equivalent in Europe of the NAB in the US ... the Broadcast Industry.
Perhaps we, and MPEG as well I think, should be represented at this event.
It falls one week before the July MPEG meeting now scheduled for Sydney the
week of 16 July.
