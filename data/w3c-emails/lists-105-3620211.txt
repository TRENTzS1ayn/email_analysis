My Position Paper for the Workshop is at:

                      DRM Will Beget DCRM

                            Abstract

The most likely path for the W3C DRM group to follow is extremely
dangerous.  Consumer access to information is directly threatened by early
digital rights management initiatives.  If W3C simply provides a framework
for such aggressive products, it will stimulate a backlash by consumers.
Some key requirements of the alternative approach are identified.
