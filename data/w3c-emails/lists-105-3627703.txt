John,
Hi! I just popped over to the mailing list archive because it occurred to me
that position papers might have been posted there (not exactly the case).

Anyway, I like your list.
But I somehow doubt that we can cover all that ground in the time allotted
unless we limit the discussion to "in-scope/out-of-scope".
We need a basic preliminary re: if/what to do in general (goals) first.
