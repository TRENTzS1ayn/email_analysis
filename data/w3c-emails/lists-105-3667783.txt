Dentsu wishes very much to participate in this workshop, but just learned
about it from Daniel Weitzner last week at the future of Music fourm in
Washington DC. Daniel strongly encouraged us to come, based on our current
work in rights management in Japan. Is it too late to send a delegate from
our development group?

Best with your ongoing work.
