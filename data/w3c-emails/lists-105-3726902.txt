Dear W3C DRM-ers,

After coming back home form our workshop, I learnt about:
http://www.w3.org/Encryption/2001/01/xmlenc-charter.html

"
  The mission of this working group is to develop a process 
  for encrypting/decyrpting digital content (including XML 
  documents and portions thereof) and an XML syntax used 
  to represent the (1) encrypted content and (2) information 
  that enables an intendent recipient to decrypt it.
"

A W3C DRM activity is apparently about to start. To the best of my 
recollection, this was not mentioned at the workshop. 

What is the relation with the discussion we had planned to 
have on this mailing list?

Thanks and Regards,

Rob Koenen
