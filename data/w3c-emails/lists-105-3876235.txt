Dear all, 

due to travelling and other committments, I was a bit late for
the minutes of the workshop. But now, I've finished and the
minutes will be available for consideration by the program
committee. The program committee will take some time, so I expect
the minutes to be published at the end of next week. We'll try
earlier, if we can...

Best,
