This article show's, that we were right to try a balanced
approach at the DRM-Workshop. It show's the potential traps of a
rights management language. I think, this is valuable input and
that we should remember it while designing a language.
Especially, we should be able to express, that the copyright has
expired...

Best, 

Rigo

content. Adobe's efforts to find the right balance are laudable.
