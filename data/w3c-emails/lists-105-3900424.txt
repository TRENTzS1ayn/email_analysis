It also shows the need for a _standard_ DRM Language so that
when the application says "Give" or "Print" - even "Read Aloud"
the consumer knows how they have been defined (and by whom).

This depends on the country - see [1] for the range of durations
for Australia. The duration will vary depending on the Type of
material (eg a Musical work Versus a Photograph) and, in some cases,
related to the death of the "author". An important piece of data
for copyright is the dates of first performance/publication.
