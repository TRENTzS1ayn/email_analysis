Rigo, all,

Thanks for publishing the report. Although I have some comments,
I think it reflects a good job in accurately conveying what was
discussed over the twoworkshop days.

The one thing that is really missing in my view (and I am echoing 
Norman's comments) is the summary that we did in the end. I really
think that list belongs in this summary, with appropriate
qualifications (it was the result of a braindump after two days
of intensive discussions).

Please add that summary.

Then, I am anxious to learn about W3C's next steps.


Detailed comments follow below.

Any view on the time schedule for this?

This is not a "should", this is the very definition of DRM:
persistent governance. 

> DRM should be about the

> rights". 

Was this the conclusion? We did discuss the 'digital mangement
of rights' versus the 'management of digital rights' yes.

Consumers need to be able to express and manage their rights
and interests, and DRM can help them do just that.

No, this was postulated as a potential solution (though I do
not understand well how it can be)

"... a good first step for interoperability, but not nearly enough"

Yes, true, but the real issue was that *Standardized*
DRM needs a Standardized Trust Infrastructure, which makes it
such a challenge.

> MPEG is addressing DRM needs and should work closely with W3C. 

Good header :-)
But the statement strikes me as funny. "MPEG should work closely
with W3C"? This can be read in a number of ways. "W3C should work
closely with MPEG" is something I have heard as well. Please make 
this comclusion more balanced, so that it doesn't (unintentionally)
sound like a requirement on MPEG alone.

(Note that MPEG has begun to address this issue in the 
 Digital Item Idnetification and Description)

But we did not agree on a framework. We just know it has
many layers.

Note that the Declaration work in itself is not about DRM.
MPEG-21 *is* though.

Good points, well captured.
Also, note that trust isn't automatically transitive or even 
reflexive.

Said who? I think (said) no DRM standardization will work without
regard for this issue.


> MPEG-4: IPMP (Intellectual Property Management and Protection) 
> MPEG-7 Multimedia Description Schemes 

MPEG-7 MDS is only one of several MPEG-7 parts, and there
are DRM implications also at MPEG-7's Systems layer.

> MPEG-21 Digital Item Identification and Description 

MPEG-21 DIID is only one of several MPEG-21 parts. Notably,
the Rights Language and Data Dictionary will be imortant too.

True about MPEG-4, much less true when taking into account 
the complete set of MPEG activities, designed to complement
each other.
(Rights messaging *is* actually addressed in MPEG-4 IPMP now)

I am unclear as to what "the same" exactly refers to.
MPEG has cetainly recognized that the MPEG-21 vision goes beyond
MPEG alone.

I thnk this is taking one specific element and putting it sort
of down as the conclusion of the workshop - see my first comment
above.

Best Regards to all who made it to the end of this mail,
