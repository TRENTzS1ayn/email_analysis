Norman, 

<indecs> was a major input and we are aware of it. This is
reflected in the position-papers and the minutes. I think a table
with related activities would help a lot. 

The interpretation I would make of your statement is, that
<indecs> is not well represented in the summary report. I would
ask for a suggestion from you and/or Godfrey. 

I therefor would appreciate, if you could help me reconstruct the
table you mentioned. This table was not minuted nor photographed. 

As I was standing with my back to it as I was chairing the
session, I have a somewhat incomplete memory of it.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Best,
