?         'Do no harm' 

?         Requirements Study 

?          seamless end user experience

?         survey and perhaps rights language, but MPEG is going into that
too and we should not duplicate.

?        state that IP is fundamental to the Internet, add field to HTTP

?        Rights Protocol

?         Steer clear of copy protection.

?         Architecture / under structure

?        Collaboration: 

o        MPEG, 

?         Relation with XML packaging

?         Dit declaration

o        <indecs>

?         Take a look at Glossary in RDF

?         Work Groups 

?        in signatures, work with experts, IETF

?        something similar to P3P, and link to that.

?         Access Rights

?        survey of legal aspects, gray areas.

?        Couple access rights to privacy rights

?        do interest group to canvas interests in society

?        expressing rights ontologies in RDF. 

?        express all of technology, legal aspects, business models

?        be generic towards data types and types of delivery (reformulated
as avoid eyes and ears focus)

?         Patent and DRM

?        go beyond scope of the web 

?        take into account for content coming from different sources
simultaneously

?        Allow for content line of usage.

?        Archiving and preservation of cultural heritage for future
generation

?        consider difference between mgt of digital rights and digital mgt

?        : look at patent rights 

o        what do you mean by that? 

o        should be expressable

o        that is out of scope.

o        MPEG does something here 

?         integrity of the content, authentication

?         human rights (not infringing), international jurisdiction
