Dear all, 

I published the photos of the DRM-Workshop in Sophia Antipolis in
January on W3C's web-site:

http://www.w3.org/2000/12/drm-ws/minutes/photo/

With respect to the right you have on your image, I did not link
it yet from the workshop's homepage. 

So please review the images and tell me (mail to rigo@w3.org), if
you don't want to appear in the collection. 

If there was no objection, I will link the collection from the
homepage next week.

Best,
