dear colleagues

On 20 November, in Amsterdam, we are hosting a one day event on Digital
Rights Management, with a special focus on DRM and the audiovisual industry.

I'd be very interested to learn from this community, if any of you wishes to
contribute to this event - see http://www.europedrm.com

At the moment, we are interested both in speakers as well as information
that could be distributed to the audience - we expect around 200
participants from the DRM and media industry to attend.

Also I would like to hear from those on this list that would appreciate
being kept up to date about this event - programme, speakers, presentations
(we post all presentations online after the event)

Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions.
If by chance, members of this group would like to schedule a meeting in
Amsterdam ,we happy to assist.

sincerely
