FYI, In years past I've found this conference to offer a particularly
interesting perspective on online copyright issues. I'd encourage anyone
who's interested and able to consider attending.

Best,

> 2. FMC Releases Results of Radio Consolidation Study
> -------------------------------------------------------
>
> On November 18, 2002 the FMC publicly released its report documenting the
> effects of radio station ownership consolidation on musicians and the
> public. This comprehensive analysis was conducted in partnership
> with Media
> Access Project and funded by a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation.
>
> The report's findings were announced at a press event at the Willard Hotel
> in Washington, DC on November 18 where FMC's Jenny Toomey,
> Kristin Thomson,
> Peter DiCola and Michael Bracy were joined by representatives from AFTRA,
> AFM, Media Access Project and Consumers' Union.
>
> The release of the study generated an impressive volume of press, not to
> mention a "fact sheet" issued by the National Association of Broadcasters
> in advance of the report's release meant to discredit our work.  You can
> visit this webpage to review the full report, the executive summary, the
> NAB's "fact sheet", our rebuttal, or any of the supporting documents:
>
>    http://www.futureofmusic.org/research/radiostudy.cfm
>
> In addition, FMC representatives were invited to the Federal
> Communications
> Commission in early December to present the findings with various
> commissioners and the FCC's Media Bureau Research Group. We'll give a more
> thorough rundown of the results of the radio study at the conference, as
> well as in our next newsletter.
>
> -------------------------------------------------------
> 3. Great Articles in the Newsstream
> -------------------------------------------------------
> There's been a significant amount of press about many issues that we care
> about, including major label accounting practices, webcasting, radio
> consolidation, pay for play, and digital distribution, many of which will
> be hot topics at the Summit.  Here's a selection:
>
> Music industry fight to block Net access hits new lows
> Editorial: Just ask any teenager: Nobody who's anybody pays retail for
> music. Thanks to software that is readily available on the Internet, free
> music files can be easily downloaded.
