>As the U.S. Congress weighs mandatory digital rights management, the
>European Commission is also looking into the topic. A 43-page EC
>study of digital rights management gives a nod to fair use and privacy
>-- and then says DRM schemes are not only inevitable but a fabulous idea.
>
>A key excerpt from the study says the EC "should continue to encourage
>all players to develop operational, open and interoperable DRM
>solutions and to deploy them rapidly." (Apparently the EC has been
>funding such schemes for the last decade.)
