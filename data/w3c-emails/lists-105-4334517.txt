Consensus may be hard to achieve as to technical standards that is seen by some 
party as 1) their private intellectual property and/or 2) is part of their 
business strategy. However, I think it is much more feasable to agree on 
certain basic rules of the game. Formulating these rules will eventually be a 
necessity for policymakers (both public authorities and businesses engaged in 
eCommerce). Technical standards will most certainly be part of the solution, 
which is were w3c and other important players in the standarization field comes 
into picture.
