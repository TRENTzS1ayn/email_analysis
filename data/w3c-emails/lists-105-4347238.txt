Rigo, I thought that the role of a "consensus based organization"
was to _form_ consensus. Not say that "there is no consensus"
therefore we cannot do anything. I think that you will also be
surprised about how much consensus there actually is out there
on dealing with DRM. W3C even had a brief glimpse of such consensus
at our DRM Workshop in Jan 2001.

As David Parrott says, DRM won't go away, so you either do nothing
and have no say in the architecture of DRM or you do something and
make sure it works.
