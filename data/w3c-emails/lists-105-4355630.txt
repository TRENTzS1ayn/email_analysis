JSE: I quite agree with Dave --- this must be about finding ways to work
together to build an accessible, enabling, trustable infrastructure upon which
to release and enjoy information. An infrastructure that embodies these values
should NOT be thought of as one-sided; indeed, imagine an environment in which
individuals enjoy the very same fine-grained policy enforcement capability that
is usually only discussed in the DRM context.

Unfortunately, when people hear "trusted platform," they tend to only think of a
particular, narrow application scenario, rather than considering the richness
that a trustable infrastructure, characterized by the pervasive ability to
create, transform and experience "data with rules," could provide.

Indeed, these issues will *not* go away; they will only multiply. One step is to
work purposefully towards standards int he hard areas; specifically, in DRM we
need to actively search for the agreeable points of interaction between systems
and solutions. These points of interaction ppint to where the standards will be
found.
