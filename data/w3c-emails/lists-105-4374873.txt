In response to Mark Baker, Rio asked:

"The Futility of Digital Copy Protection"

BTW, I would strongly recommend Lawrence Lessig's latest book, "The Future of
Ideas." He picks up where his excellent "Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace" left
off.

I can't say that I completely agree with the conclusions he makes throughout,
but I do find his pocitions well-presented and challenging to think through. As
we enter a world that will likely be characterized by the widespread propagation
of trusted platforms (from devices to general-purpose PCs) and, possibly,
pervasive fine-grained policy enforcement, it is absolutely critical that we
consider the implications.
