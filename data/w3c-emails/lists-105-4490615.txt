I totally agree with Dave on this one.  It's harder than it should be to 
find (since it took me searching the doc for "free" instead of just 
skimming it) but it's expressed in the description of the XMCL initiative:

"Second, it proposes that all media content has business rules (implicit or 
explicit). Attaching business rules to content isn't necessarily about 
enforcing payment or maintaining security. It is equally valid for a 
content creator to want to allow free loans of the content or to prevent 
others from charging for the use of their digital media." from 
http://www.xmcl.org/initiative.html.

The point of automated rights management is that "works" can be made more 
accessible and more easily found because the rights holder can be assured 
their wishes are respected without having to resort to off line restrictions.
