Automated rights management for assets in/on the Web is crucial to the 
continued evolution of the Web and its use as a world community resource 
for communication and sharing.  If I have something to contribute but care 
how it's used, there has to be a way for me express my wishes or I won't 
contribute.  It's perfectly reasonable to imagine someone not caring who 
uses pet rocks to make others smile until somebody else starts selling them 
as a business.  They might not be interested in making money from the rocks 
but may strongly believe that nobody should charge for a smile.  We've had 
non-automated rights management for software programs for decades in 
"licenses" for Shareware nags and GPL.  Some argue that this non-automated 
best effort is good enough, but I see an opportunity for my computer to do 
more work for me over time and not have to got to the legal department to 
verify I can use some piece of Open Source code that seems to be just 
asking for beer if I use it.  That's what I mean by automated rights 
management.  It's not about locking up ideas or art or performances, it's 
about enabling the computer to handle the question as to if use of a work 
is within the wishes of the creator of the work.

A facility for automated rights management should be part of the Web 
Architecture, just as accessibility and privacy are.  I believe it is in 
the charter of the W3C participate in defining a rights expression 
architecture.  Rigo previously wrote:

I believe it's exactly this experience with community consensus not just 
among the members and industry but consensus with the "Web community at 
large" that make the W3C the best choice of a standards body to take up 
this work an be successful.
