   CALL FOR PAPERS: Peer-2-Peer E-commerce Systems and Applications
                in the Software Technology Track
                   at the Thirty-sixth Annual
          HAWAI'I INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEM SCIENCES
                     on the Big Island of Hawaii
                        January 6 - 9, 2003

                Additional detail on the web sites:
                 http://cui.unige.ch/OSG/hicss36/
                   http://www.hicss.hawaii.edu/

The purpose of this one day minitrack is to provide a forum for researchers
and practitioners to discuss software technology issues related to the emerging
peer-2-peer paradigm. We envisage an interdisciplinary forum which brings together
participants with technology background and practitioners from both the industry
and the open source community to discuss and evaluate the technology aspect as
well as the interplay between technological capabilities and new emerging forms
of commercial electronic interaction. Examples of such systems are found in B2B
ecommerce (e.g. electronic marketplaces, mySAP, etc.) and C2C ecommerce (e.g.
information exchange communities such as Napster, Gnutella, etc.), community
efforts and P2P platforms such as Project JXTA and related technology, and
systems for digital rights management, trust management and trust computing.
Project JXTA is a recent example of community effort toward P2P computing.
Peer-2-Peer computing as a paradigm for programming distributed systems is
characterized by an increasing decentralization and autonomy of components.

Contributions of interest will be those that describe novel business interaction
and user coordination models, the supporting information systems and new types of
systems and applications supporting the peer-2-peer paradigm. Topics related to
the paradigm of peer-2-peer e-commerce include, but are not limited to, the
following:

       - security and payment mechanisms
       - mobile objects (Agents)
       - semantic transformation and discovery
       - rights languages for electronic goods and services
       - digital rights management (DRM)
       - trust management and trust computing
       - P2P system architectures
       - community platforms
       - self organizing information systems
       - auction, negotiation and bidding mechanisms
       - multi-agent systems
       - electronic marketplaces
       - support for virtual enterprises
       - real time management information systems
       - digital asset management and trading
