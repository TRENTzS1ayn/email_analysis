David, I'm obviously way behind on my email, but I thank you for the piece 
on rights, which I will look over more carefully in the next few days.

I am concerned about the enumeration of rights as well, but perhaps from 
another point of view. As someone involved in academic/non-profit 
information I find the requirement to list of positive rights to be a 
barrier. How would I, in most rights languages today, state that I wish the 
work to be in the public domain? Must I list EVERYTHING that one is allowed 
to do with the work? Similarly if I want my file to have to standard GNU 
licensing terms - I would have a long list of "do's" to express what is a 
fairly simple license.

Copyright law tells you what you cannot do, and leaves the rest to your 
imagination. This prevents certain behaviors but allows for some level of 
freedom and innovation. Reversing this to be: "if it isn't listed here you 
can't do it" is going to run afoul of technological change very quickly.

If nothing else I want DRM systems to have a switch where I can say: this 
license lists permissions/this license lists prohibitions.
