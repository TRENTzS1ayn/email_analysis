Hi Karen, 

a very interesting suggestion that also would cover the grey-areas we
defined at the DRM-Workshop. 

Perhaps Renato can tell us more whether ODRL could also work with this
upside-down concept. It might also be the case that this can make DRM
less threatening in the overall community thus making it overall
possible. The best was always the enemy of the good. The will for 
too much protection might hinder any acceptance of protection. 

..yet another piece in the mosaic..

I'm pleased to see that my comment on the submission triggered a
reaction. It has taken me a long time as I tried to really understand.

Cheers,
