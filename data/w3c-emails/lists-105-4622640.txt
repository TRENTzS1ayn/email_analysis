Karen,

I have never been comfortable with positive rules only.

Indeed, none of my requirements submissions to the various standards
efforts has ever assumed positive rights only.  As you say, it is often
far simpler to list negative exceptions than positive rules.

There is a tendency for technologists to vote for whatever is the more
straightforward to implement.  I believe that is why there is a bias
towards positive rules only.  On the other hand, whatever languages
become the standards, they must be technically "implementable" in the
domains in which we seek to implement them.

Usually, the best way to drive these things is to participate in the
standards efforts and to submit use-cases.  I don't know of any academic
studies of expressiveness for the various flavours of language construct
that exist today (grateful to hear, if anyone else does), so use-case
scenarios are probably the best we have right now for testing
expressiveness.

Regards,
/Dave.
