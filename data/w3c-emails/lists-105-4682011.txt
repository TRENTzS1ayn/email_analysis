"OpenDRM: A Standards Framework for Digital Rights Expression, Messaging and
Enforcement"

The lack of open, accessible, interperable standards for digital rights
management has often been cited by stakeholders as a leading cause for the slow
adoption of DRM technologies. The fact that layered standards can contribute to
interoperability should be obvious; that DRM standards developed in an open
environment can contribute to the PUBLIC INTEREST is a more subtle, but equally
important point.

The attached document is a collection of thoughts that I have been developing
and maintaining for several years on the notion of a multi-layered, open DRM
standards architecture, which I think of as "OpenDRM." Some aspects of this
argument have been articulated in earlier works such as [PREP] and [FairUse].
These comments are not meant to reflect any specific project by my employer or
of any standards group, but simply my current, personal view of the world.
