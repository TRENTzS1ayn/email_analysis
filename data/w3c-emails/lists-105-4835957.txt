      Thursday, February 27- Saturday, March 1, 2003  

Boalt Hall School of Law and the School of Information Management
and Systems at the University of California, Berkeley are pleased
to announce this year's groundbreaking conference on digital
rights management. 

As industry increasingly embraces digital delivery systems and
looks to develop and implement technological protection measures
to protect their information, it is increasingly important for you
to understand how your work intersects with intellectual property,
privacy, and contract law.

We invite you to join leaders from industry, academia, government,
and the nonprofit sector such as Mozelle Thompson (Commissioner,
Federal Trade Commission), Congresswomen Zoe Lofgren
(D-California), Cary Sherman (General Counsel, Recording Industry
Association of America), Lucky Green (cypherpunks.to), Larry
Lessig (Professor of Law, Stanford University), Edward Felten,
(Professor of Computer Science, Princeton University), Mike
Chartier (Director of Regulator Policy of Wireless Group, Intel),
and Barb Fox (Senior Software Architect, Cryptography and Digital
Rights Management, Microsoft Corporation) and many more to discuss
the legal, technological, and policy landscape of digital rights
management systems, learn about recent developments, and debate
the future balance of content protection, fair use, and privacy.

Please join us for this year's conference, Feb. 27-Mar. 1, and
don't get left behind in the most important change in the area of
law and technology today. 

Registration for the Thursday tutorial and Friday and Saturday
conference are both limited, so visit
http://www.law.berkeley.edu/bclt/drm/ today for more information
and online registration. 

      Please forward this announcement to any interested colleagues.
