Greetings,

I am doing some research on how Digital Rights Management can be used in
conjunction with electronic forms (such as Adobe, PureEdge, etc.). I've
reviewed the ODRL 1.1 specification, and am interested in insight on how
ODRL could be used to satisfy the following high-level requirements:

(1) Assocate an access control list with an e-form, so that user access
can be enforced

(2) Enforce access of an e-form to a file system (perhaps through LDAP)
to disallow an e-form from accessing a file system inappropriately

Thank you in advance for any comments you may be able to provide.

Kind Regards,
Joe Chiusano
