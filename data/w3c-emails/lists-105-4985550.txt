   CALL FOR PAPERS: Peer-2-Peer Ecommerce Systems and Applications
                 in the Software Technology Track
                   at the Thirty-seventh Annual
          HAWAI'I INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEM SCIENCES
                    on the Big Island of Hawaii
                        January 5 - 8, 2004

                Additional detail on the web sites:

The purpose of this minitrack is to provide a forum for researchers and
practitioners to discuss software technology issues related to the emerging
peer-to-peer paradigm. We envisage an interdisciplinary forum bringing together
participants with technology background and practitioners from both the industry
and the open source community to discuss and evaluate the technology aspect as
well as the interplay between technological capabilities and new emerging forms
of commercial electronic interaction. Examples of such systems include electronic
marketplaces, information exchange, collaborative systems, P2P protocols and
architectures, etc.
P2P computing provides a new paradigm of distributed computing requiring new
approaches and patterns. In this context, several technologies appear to converge
among which Peer-to-Peer frameworks, Mobile Agents, Digital Rights Management /
Digital Policy Management, trust computing, cognitive or knowledge agents and
ontologies. This convergence provides new opportunities to design novel IT
architectures to support new organizational forms and flexible ways of conducting
and reengineering businesses.

Contributions of interest will be those that describe novel business interaction
and user coordination models, the supporting information systems and new types of
systems and applications supporting the peer-to-peer paradigm. Topics related to
the paradigm of peer-to-peer Ecommerce include, but are not limited to, the
following:

       - P2P system architectures and protocols
       - security and payment mechanisms
       - mobile agents
       - semantic transformation and discovery
       - rights languages for electronic goods and services
       - digital rights management and policy management (DRM/DPM)
       - trust and reputation management
       - community platforms
       - self organizing information systems
       - auction, negotiation and bidding mechanisms
       - multi-agent systems
       - electronic marketplaces
       - support for virtual enterprises
       - real time management information systems
       - digital asset management and trading
