Dear Petro, 

I haven't seen reviews from an ODRL Workshop in 2003. But ODRL was
discussed at the W3C Workshop on Digital Rights Management[1]. 

ODRL was also submitted and accepted as a W3C Member-Submission[2]. 
see also (my) W3C Staff comment[3].

I think, most of the things can be found in the archives of this 
list[4].
