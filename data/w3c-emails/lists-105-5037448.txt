Digital Rights management is about getting payed for the content.
However, this is very much easier said than done. Considering the fact,
that this whole business lies in a revenue share model. Not only the
content has to be sold, but also the revenue model has to be internally
sold from investors to content owners. I seek to find such a forum where
we dont talk logic and/or concepts/visions but business.
 
please help me
