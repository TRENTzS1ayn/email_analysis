====================================
   ODRL International Workshop 2004
   Vienna, Austria 21-23 April 2004
====================================

Over the past four years the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL)
Initiative has gained international significance in the field of
digital rights management (DRM) for many sectors and communities.

Rights Expression Languages (REL) enable the formalisation of standard
and interoperable semantic agreements and contracts from rights
holders over the usage of their content by end users and other parties.
RELs, like ODRL, are seen as key infrastructure for the management
and trading of digital content on the Internet.

The ODRL rights expression language has been adopted as an
international standard by the Open Mobile Alliance for mobile
content and numerous projects and groups around the world.

The ODRL International Workshop will be held at The Vienna
University of Economics and Business Administration from
Wednesday 21 April to Friday 23 April 2004.

The objective of the ODRL International Workshop is to bring
together the research and industry communities to share experiences
and discuss the future developments of the language to ensure its
timeliness, usability, openness, and future success.

requirements for the Workshop at:
