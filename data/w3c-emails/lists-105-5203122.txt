www-email-announce Mailing List Administrativia: 

www-email-announce@w3.org is a low volume moderated mailing list for
announcements relating to Web access through email.  New releases of
server software for services such as Agora, GetWeb, WWW4Mail are all
within the scope of this mailing list.

There is also a public discussion list, www-email-discuss@w3.org.  All
postings to www-email-announce@w3.org are also sent to
www-email-discuss@w3.org, so that you do not need to be on both
lists.

Consider reading Bob Rankin's guide to accessing the Internet through
email before posting. This guide is available at
<http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/internet-services/access-via-email/faq.html>.
You can also get this guide by sending the following message through email:  

To: mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu 
Enter only this line in the BODY of the note:
  send usenet/news.answers/internet-services/access-via-email

All mailing list administrativia MUST be sent to a *-request address,
never to the list itself. For www-email-announce@w3.org, for example, send
mailing list requests to www-email-announce-request@w3.org. Mail sent to the
*-request address can have one of the following words in the Subject
header: 

subscribe 
     Subscribe to the list. Note, that you won't get an
     acknowledgement if you are already subscribed - call it a bug or
     a feature - this is how our listserver works! If you want to
     subscribe under a
     different address, use a Reply-To header in the message. 
unsubscribe 
     Unsubscribe from the list. This can be done from an address
     different from the one you subscribed from. 
help 
     Get information about the mailing list. 
archive help 
     Get information about the list archive(s). All our mailing lists
     are archived and most archives are accessible from the Web 

Most (un)subscription requests are processed automatically without
human intervention. Do not send multiple (un)subscription or info
requests in one mail. Only one will be processed per mail. 

The *-request server usually does quite a good job in discriminating
between (un)subscribe requests and messages intended for the
maintainer. If you for some reason would like to make sure a human
reads
your message, make it look like a reply (i.e. the first word in the
"Subject:" field should be "Re:", without the quotes of course); the
*-request server does not react to replies. 

Changing Address 

In the event of an address change, first send an unsubscribe for the
old address (this can be done from the new address), and then a new
subscribe from the new address (the order is important).
