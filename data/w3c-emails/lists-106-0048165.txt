Well,
If you set the Subject line, it is included automatically in the returned
subject line to you!
So, one solution is to set the Subject line of the outgoing mail to
something you like. The reply from www4mail would have a subject line that
contains your previous subject line.

I think the only exception to the above rule is when you use the XUUDEVIEW
command, this tries to format the subject line in a format that is
acceptable to the uudeview software combiner.

Thanks
Clement Onime
