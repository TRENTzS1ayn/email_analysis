Dear Clement,

there is perhaps a little bug in the handling of form post results with
redirections.
After I posted the form contained in
<http://www.megatime.de/uhren/loesung.htm>
(which had a form field
"redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.megatime.de%2Fuhren%2Fok33.htm")
I received in the response

Method Not Allowed

The requested method POST is not allowed for the URL /uhren/ok33.htm.

Could it be the case that when the result of the posting of a form
contains a redirect tag, the target of the redirection is fetched also
with method POST, while it should be fetched with method GET?

Best regards,
Dietmar
