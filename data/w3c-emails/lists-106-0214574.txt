Dear Clement,

I have a problem. There are web pages which contain single CR characters
as line delimiters (e. g. http://www.fujifilm2000.de/f6/adress.html).
When I request such a page with "tsource", in the response the CRs are
all gone, giving one very long line. I found that our mail server drops
the CRs. This causes trouble especially when the page contains Java
script with "//" comments, because the comment extends to the end of the
long line, hiding part of the script.
Of course I could use the uuencode option and would get the documents
uncorrupted, but I would rather not enlarge the response that much. An
encoding as quoted-printable would add much less overhead in this case.
Is there a way I can request quoted-printable encoding with www4mail?
If not, then it would be great if you could implement such an option in
some future release.

Best regards,
Dietmar
