Hi !
I am using your www4mail to get technical informations from Internet.
Because I have no access directly to www, and the System where I work
uses MSMail, I send requestes by this MSMail, open the received html
form with Netscape,  choose documents and/or files and reply again by Netscape.
It Works.

I'm trying to get a pdf document :
http://www.mot.com/SPS/HPESD/aesop/680X0/030/68030UM.pdf

If i send to www4mail via MSMail the above line, I get only the LAST
attachment :
(Final 8 of 8) - 68030um_.008

Where are the others seven ?

I tried with "GETPART 1-8", but again I received the last one.
I tried "XUUENCODE" ; I received the second, third, and the last one.
I'm now specifying "GETPART n" eight times

I must say that www4mail works fast , sometimes I receive an answer
within 30 minutes (or less in the early morning), but this strange
behaviour disappoints me. The HELP says that a document will be
splitted if is larger than 300k, and parts will be sent by separated
e-mails. Must I specify any command in the request to get ALL parts of
the whole file ? Or is there an other problem ?

        Best regards
