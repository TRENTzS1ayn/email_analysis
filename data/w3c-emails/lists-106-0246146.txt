Okay,
The following behaviour is for the wm.ictp.trieste.it Server.
First www4mail tries to deliver directly to your mail domain name. This
fails in your case beacuse, you have a Mail Exchanger host.

Now this behaviour is common to all www4mail servers
Now the mail is handed over to the local MTA (sendmail).
Sendmail sends smaller files first, which means you get the last part
first as it usually smaller. Then since the rest are large files, sendmail
queues them for later delivery! Usually, this may mean that as long as
there small files to send, your mails would be delayed!

Okay, I expect that you will get the missing parts in a few hours from
now!.

I shall try to improve the mail delivery service!

Thanks
Clement Onime
