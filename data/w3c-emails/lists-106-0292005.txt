Dear Clement,

thank you for your advice, but I don't understand two things.

1. How can XMIME be of use here? The help file says "... using XMIME you
can force the sending of html attachments using a MIME header of
application/html". In which way does this affect the body contents?

2. How can I use GETSIZE to force compression? I tried with a size
greater than the document length and received it uncompressed. Did you
mean to use a size less than the document length? In this case I would
have to choose a very small size, because I don't know the document
length before I receive it, and larger documents would then be sent in
a great lot of parts.

However, using XUUENCODE is an acceptable workaround, even if I always
get an extra message with it.

Best regards,
Dietmar
