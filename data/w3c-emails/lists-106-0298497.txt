Okay,

Since XMIME changes the MIME header, it would discourage the Mail Server
and also mail Clients from trying to read the message! That way they just
treat is as a binary file.

Using getsize
=============
Let's say you do send the command GETSIZE 15000. If the Web Page is larger
than 15k then www4mail will zip it and send you the zipped version!

Thanks
Clement
