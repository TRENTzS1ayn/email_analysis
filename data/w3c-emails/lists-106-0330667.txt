Dear Sir:
    Thanks for the services you provided. I prefer it. But When I use it
on outlook express 5.0 with NT4.0 + sp5i386.exe + ie5. I can't get the
result I expect. I browse the infomation with IE5, and make selection,
at last I click button "Get Selected Document(s)". What I get is the
mail without content. It would be better if you can correct it.


Your sincerely
Lilac
