I can´t reach to http://www.artchive.com
I send an email to www4mail@wm.ictp.trieste.it with the body : Tsource >http://
www.artchive.com
but I receive bad news, because my email server told me: "Please confirm >the H
OSTNAME, the machine does not exist."
How can I know if that machine exist really?
I knew and was adviced to visit that site for my subscribe from >TOURBUS@listse
rv.aol.com
That www site could be very important for me.
I hope hears from yours.
