Clueless newbies send dozens www4mail commands daily to
<www4mail-comments@w3.org>. All subscribers of the www-email-discuss
list get that garbage. Please alter slightly the address on www4mail
servers' statistics page: write "www4mail-comments @ w3.org" instead
of "www4mail-comments@w3.org". It may prevent at least part of garbage.
