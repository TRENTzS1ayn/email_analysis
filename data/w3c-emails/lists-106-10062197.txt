    Hi !
I live at Vietnamese and I often access Internet via www4mail . I know your
server can access website with "Requesting Password-protected Web/FTP sites"
but I couldn't . I send the mail with content :
            To:  www4mail@web.bellanet.org
            Subject:
    Body :
eoiabupm@supermeriaout.com:2uitoa8b">http://eoiabupm@supermeriaout.com:2uitoa8b
@\
www.abc........ (for instant)

But your server reply for me :

Error 404  - Site not Found - NO DNS Entry found - The require host does not
exist
Bad hostname

Why ? Please help me access Website have Username and Password , please !
Thanks



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
User authentication support for password-protected sites is also available
by www4mail.  To access such Web site/pages conforming to the pattern
`protocol://username:password@site/directory' you need to know (and then
pass on) the correct USERNAME and PASSWORD.

In these cases send an e-mail



where site/path is the machine,domain,directory,file you want to retrieve
and the @-sign is used to separate the string `username:password' from the
site/path.
