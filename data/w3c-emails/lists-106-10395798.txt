Dear manager:
Thank you for your fine service and cooperation. It seems that you have
24 hrs. service system, but in previous week I couldn't use your service
for three days( Tuesday-Thursday).
I would greatly appreciate, if you could inform me your schedule and
tell me if that problem was a temporary problem.
Thanking you in advance.

S.Mehdipour
