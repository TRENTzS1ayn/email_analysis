Hi www4mail-comments@w3.org , hope you are having a nice day

I'd like to fetch a file via e-mail but i've got a message unreadable.
I'm blind so you please give me info about taking files through a
fidonet-internet-gateway. The file is a .zip-file, and i can't unpack
the message i've got. I guess it is uuencoded but my mailprogram -
Termail - can't uudecode. Please help!

Please send reply to the above address.

 -=> Yours sincerely, Soren Willemoes <=-
