Hi,

what's wrong when I want to check the links of the received html document
and send them through Outlook ? Outlook opens only new message with the
address where to send but there's nothing in the body of the message !
I think there have to be the links I marked on the web page. Am I wrong ?
Which option to use ? Or have I to put the links to documents I want
manually ?

Thanks for your reply.

Regards,
Marian
