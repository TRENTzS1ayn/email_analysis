I'm a turkish student. I have a problem, whet I'm getting pages sometimes it
adds 3D to url like instead of www.website.com/something I get
www.website.com/some3Dthing so it doesn't send me anything also every time I
write something in a search box and send it it adds this 3D and I can't
search anything. Do you think this is because I'm using Turkish Outlook
Express and Internet Explorer.I think you shall ckeck it.

Yours
sincerely,
Senol Yilmaz
