Hello!  Would you please tell how to correct this error?
I sent a filtered webpage USSEARCH1800(newest version) by direct surfing and
got this ERROR Report. I copied the form body from this Message, made sure
that the email head was
  MIME-Version: 1.0
  Content-Type: text/plain
  charset="iso-8859-1"
  Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
and sent you as email. Again this same ERROR Report. I have failed many
times. Please explain in detail.

I use IE5.01(version Simplified Chinese), Netscape4.71(English version).
I take great care about charset/encoding and avoid Western(Windows), UTF-7,
UTF-8, GB2312(i.e. Simplified Chinese), but Often Outlook Express changes my
emails from iso-8859-1 to Western(Windows). Do you accept Western(Windows)?
No ASCII seems to be available in Outlook Express.
Thanks for help!
