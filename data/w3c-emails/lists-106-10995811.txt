Hello!

Your www4mail service is a nice one...

But...sometimes I use a special
internetmail service which doesn't
allow me to type a "backslash"
character, so I can'trequest url of
more than 40 letters...
making it unusable...
Is there, by any luck, another
character to separate long url's ?
and if not, could there be one, like
the "*" sign for example...

thanks a lot!
