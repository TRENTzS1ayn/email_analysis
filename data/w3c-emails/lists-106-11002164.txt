Hi, there!

The question is: How can I get more?
I'm frustrated by your limitation of 5 pages a letter.
I need so many pages of about 5Kb long. What do I do?

Can you at least suggest any other server
which doesn't have a restriction like that?
And doesn't require a command 'get' before http://...
For it's tiresome, you know.

Thank you anyway,
        Best Wishes,
                Eugene.
