Hello! Your work is satisfying ,exhilarating!  Could you answer me?
  Question   <www4mail@web.bellanet.org> sent me IE3LPKTW.EXE
base64-encoded (conversion of Chinese characters used in HongKong
to Chinese characters used in mainland China), 6 MB, in 21 parts,
each part as email ATTACHMENT. And another copy of this same file
uuencoded in 21 parts, each part in email BODY.  Would you please
tell me how can I install them respectively?  With the base64 version
attachments I am utterly helpless. With the uuencoded, I double-click
in WIN98 Explorer ie3lpktw.uue>in WinZip Main Window all IE3L's
21 parts appeared>SELECT ALL>EXTRACT Button>in WIN98 Explorer
the same 21 parts appeared, stubbornly refusing to be combined
into one large file IE3LPKTW.EXE ready for constant use.  I need
to learn how to install these 2 cases because they are very common
in Internet software downloading and installing. Do I need new editor?
{ My computer: Celeron 300A, 64 MB memory, 6 GB disk, 32*CD-ROM,
WINdow98. Netscape Communicator4.4,  MS IE4(I use Netscape),
Writepad, MS Word7.0, WinZip6.3(can decode MIME base64),
MS-DOS(I do not use it as it is inconvenient), F-PROT306A }

  Suggestion   1.WWW4MAIL is very convenient for seeking and
downloading files, far better than ARCHIE, AGORA,FTP.
It would be ideal to replace your  HELP SPLIT with a
big section on INSTALLING COMMON-TYPES DOWNLOADED FILES
with WIN98,95,WinZip (as being common tools) (e.g. the above
2 cases)?    To quote your HELP SPLIT:
  " Other operating system(s):
      You can use a binary copy program or a binary editor to
      join the separate parts "
such vague instruction seems of little help to us newbies.
               2.How to download files bigger than 6 MB,use
command FTPGET?
               3.How to use WHOWHERE and find email address,
telephone number, street address of colleges,Microsoft Co,
NewYork Times, Times Journal, Neurological Association in US,
UN organizations, Canadian Embassy in Beijing?
               4.Your searching for keywords is very
convenient,powerful. Would you please consider searching
for Chinese keywords using SEARCH ENGINES as
http://gbchinese.yahoo.com       www.whatsize.com.tw
www.sohu.com.cn       www.yeah.net       www.goyoyo.com.cn?
Many thanks, cheers!
