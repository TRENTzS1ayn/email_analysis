There is an option in MS Outlook 2000 to limit the size of messages that get
downloaded from the server. Problem is, once the limit is set, any messages
that exceed the limit do not get downloaded, but also they do not move off
the server, resulting in an error message informing you of "message too
large" every time you check for mail.  Is there any way to stop this
happening?
