Hi Bug-fixer!
OK, this probably isn't a bug, rather just my poor attempt to poll
yahoo.com with a search search for dog + cat.
I am told > Sorry, no matches were found containing 3ddog+cat
Hey! I did a search for dog+cat NOT 3ddog+cat

What's going on here?
Here's what I sent to yuhoo
    [snip]

XFORM=FORM ACTION http://search.yahoo.com/bin/search METHOD GET
XBASE = http://www.yahoo.com/
XFORMREPLY = TEXT
p=dog+cat
Search=on
XSUBMIT_NOW = on
XFORM= /FORM
