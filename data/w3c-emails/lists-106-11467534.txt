Hi,

I started to use your server two,three weeks ago with a quote of  80-90
messages per week UNUSED. The problem started when I requested
6 'sends' (maybe 1 or 2 more, mainly text docs, in one message ...
From that time there is no response at all.
I've looked in your help and found 5 'sends' allowed.
Whats my ststus now?
thank you in adv.
