Hi:
        I have downloaded www4mail server. I read very carefully all readme
file and configure the server by it, and it don't run. Well, it run,
but it not plaace signals that run. I send messages to user
www4mail@informatica5.biomundi.inf.cu, the message arrive to that
user, but the server www4mail that I run at the prompt of user
www4mail not get the message. How the server get the messages and
process the information.

The aplication not write anything in the files access.log, quota.log
and full.log

What happen?
