#  You're in my hair with your MORALITY!
#  Why do you think that all JPG is PORNO?
#      It's just marriage site!
#  Could i look at FACE of my future mate?
#   I got all other URLS from that site except .JPG
#  It is not password protected site,it's Marriage Agency.
#     Look thru every JPG requested yourself to be sure it is porno or not.
#  and ban it after that.
