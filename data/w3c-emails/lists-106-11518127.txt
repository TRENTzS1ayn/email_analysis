Dear Sir or Madam,
I would like to express my gratitude for your very (!) usefull survey
aspecially for such users who have access to e-mail only.
But I have question to you - whether it is possible to use any
search Internet machines by using key words ?
If Yes how could I form such kind of requests ?
Thanks in advance,

Igor Yefanov
