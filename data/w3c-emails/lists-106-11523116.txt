Hi Igor,

the www4mail help about forms contains an example
for searching with Yahoo.

Just request:
help forms

You can use any search engine.
Just start with their URL for to get their specific search form.


This is an answer by Onime Clement
to a similar question like yours, dated two months ago:

It is also described there how to use command "search"
for easy keyword input without having to fill out a form.


regards,

Dear Sir or Madam,
I would like to express my gratitude for your very (!) usefull survey
aspecially for such users who have access to e-mail only.
But I have question to you - whether it is possible to use any
search Internet machines by using key words ?
If Yes how could I form such kind of requests ?
Thanks in advance,
