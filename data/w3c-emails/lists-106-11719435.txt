Now in order to answer your question, www4mail does not execute
javascript code on behave of users.

I do believe that you can do a little bit better than this.
First you need the URL of the current page, your are viewing.
Let's say the javascript reference came from a page from
www.javascript.com

Looking at the code below, you should simply request for the following
page:

XGET=http://www.javascript.com/popup/post.html?gid=13951
