Dear Mike,

I am not sure if you got any reply to this.
I notice that you wrote GETSIZE was written as GTESIZE

Well, www4mail checks the file size after MIME or UUENCODE encode of the
file.
As far as I remember www4mail should accept anything from about 10000 to
300000

PS: if the problem is still on, then kindly inform me as to which server
is giving the problem.

Thanks
Clement Onime
