When I requested an HTML page that had a relative anchor link in it (<a
href="#top">blah</a>), the link was listed as:

  17. file://localhost/tmp/20813_20813_9738809571.htm#top

If this bug should go to Bellanet.org (the service I made the request
through) I'll be happy to bass it on to them.

cheers,
