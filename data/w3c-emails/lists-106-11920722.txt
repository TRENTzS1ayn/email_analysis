I am not sure if i can contact you about this but any help is greatly
appreciated

I am having a problem we have written an application for inhouse use and
have written in a small email app but for it to work the user needs to have
MS Outlook open, having it installed on the pc is not a problem but as we
use Lotus Notes as our mail server, it does become an issue for the users
to open outlook every time they need to send an email from the system

Thank you for your time

Regards
