Well,
Unfortunately the wm.ictp.trieste.it server does not access anything
larger than 6 MB.
The limit is a server configurable parameter that each site may
modify to thier taste.

This limit is enforced on the total file size and not parts of the the
file.

Using the limit on just parts of of a file means you can download a 100 MB
file simply by calling for it in parts.
