Hello,

I constantly used yours server. But now i don't receive  nothing from
yours server(my ordered letters such as: html-pages, files, and so
on). I send letter - inquiry, but nothing comes, why?
Our server is last hope, because i have only mail-box(no really
Internet). Thank you.

P.S. Excuse me for my english.

With best regards,
   Toothman(Alex Zubov)              mailto:toothman@mail.iks.ru
