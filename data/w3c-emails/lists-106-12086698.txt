Hi !
My name is Valerii Stolnikov. I knew about this GREAT service few days ago.
I have not direct Internet access. So i very glad that service WWW4MAIL is
existing. My question:
First (yesterday), I used www4mail@collaborium.org . My quota decreased time
by time. But suddenly (today) I saw that my quota is rised up to maximum.
After that I can't recieve files. Instead of requested file I get little
.txt or .html file and nothing more. By the way quota decreasing.
For example I ordered file
http://www.dcscomputer.com.tw/download/drivers/Yamaha%20win%209x%20driver%20
ver%20dw2234.exe
In the mail body I splited this URL by 2 lines. But I received file with
such name with another content ->

HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Server: Microsoft-IIS/3.0
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Last-Modified: Tue, 24 Oct 2000 07:38:40 GMT

I tried another service www4mail@wm.ictp.trieste.it and received this file
without any troubles.
Thanks for this very usefull service and sorry for bad english.

with best regards,
valerast@hsbk.kz
