hello,

our company-mailserver keeps sending me my www4mail requests
(directed to: www4mail@wm.ictp.trieste.it) back claiming them to
be undeliverable.

when i first tried your service (around 19th of november) it seemed
to work fine.

are there problems involved on your side or on mine?

regards

we-
