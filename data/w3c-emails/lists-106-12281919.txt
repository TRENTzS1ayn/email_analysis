When I try to fetch a web page in PS format I got this from the response:

"HELP TIP:  For more information send the command "help mime"
 sh: html2ps: command not found"

And I can't see the PS file with GV.

Thanks and BTW thanks a lot for doing www4mail! I use it a lot for news and
research since I don't have internet connection at home and I only have email a
t
work. Thanks a lot!
