JUNO has an approximately 60KB email size limit. I have been fruitlessly
trying to get
http://see.gsfc.nasa.gov/edu/SEES/strat/class/Chap_1/1_Js/1-01.jpg which
is close to 60KB in size when MIME encoded.  I've tried GTESIZE 60000,
55000 and 50000 but your software will not clip the file into multiple
parts! It keeps trying to send the whole encoded file in one piece which
is too big for JUNO and JUNO truncates it so I can't get the whole file.
Other files that are somewhat bigger I got no problem. Apparently the
software decides for me on its own when it's close to just go ahead and
send it in one piece. It shouldn't work like that- when I need something
a certain size, I have good reason and that's the size it should be.
Sheesh.
Thanks for looking into this,
Mike

PS- I will attempt one more time using GETSIZE 30000 but one shouldn't
have to play games like that, even if it works. The software should
simply obey the getsize command and not try to 2nd guess the user.
