Hello there!

I've been using this service something about a halv of year and my
opinion us that is great!
But i want to say you about one bug:
four days ago i sent request to send me the file  http://www.cea.ru/~serp/fyute
ch/r/index.htm
and now every day www4mail sends it several times per day.
For this four days i get something about 30 files. Please stop sending
it!
