Hi,

Any insight into this? I was totally confused at first, but then I took a
look at http://www.pagegetter.com and it seems PageGetter.com seeks to get a
patent on what we have been doing for years using www4mail etc. Quoi faire?
Seems a rather agressive way to tell us they are also now offering a
commercial variant of www4mail... a slightly different approach might even
make me excited to hear about it.

Try it out: write to web@pagegetter.com with the URL in the subject/body of
the message.

Cheers,

Tobias
