hi,

turns out there was an interesting misunderstanding relating to
pagegetter.com - they are not in any way aggressively trying to shut down
the competition. Sorry for any misunderstanding. The service looks
appealing, however it is advertising driven. Check it out and let me know if
you have insights.

I'm still keen to try to fix www4mail@kabissa.org but I am not able to get
an updated version of the program. Can somebody e-mail it to me? Steve - you
were very helpful last time. Can I maybe ask you to help again?

Cheers,

Tobias

  Hi,

  Any insight into this? I was totally confused at first, but then I took a
look at http://www.pagegetter.com and it seems PageGetter.com seeks to get a
patent on what we have been doing for years using www4mail etc. Quoi faire?
Seems a rather agressive way to tell us they are also now offering a
commercial variant of www4mail... a slightly different approach might even
make me excited to hear about it.

  Try it out: write to web@pagegetter.com with the URL in the subject/body
of the message.

  Cheers,

  Tobias
