To whom it may concern,

My name is Abelardo from Mexico City. I'm working  in a project about
bridge construction and I have a question. During the mount of the
structure there are parts (plates) to be joined by grooves welds with root
openings of 30 mm. The thickness of the plates are 5/8 ".

In accordance to AWS D.1.5, paragraph 3.3.4.1, "Root opening not greater
than twice the thickness of the thinner part or 20 mm, whichever is less,
may be corrected by welding to acceptable dimensions prior to joining the
parts by welding". In my case 20 mm is the maximum root opening.

On the other hand, in paragraph 3.3.4.2 of AWS D1.5, tell: "Root openings
larger than those permitted in 3.3.4.1 may be corrected by welding only
with the approval of Engineer".

I like to know if is possible to permitted apply welding with backing in
parts to be joined with root openings with 30 mm (In fact, we have a PQR of
this procedure), and Where I can get information about background of
similar cases during bridges constructions in the world.? Could you help
me, please?

Sincerely,

Abelardo Amaro
México City
