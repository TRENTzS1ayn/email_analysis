Dear friends,

Thank you ever so much for this good news. I look forward to seeing the new
version and trying it out on Kabissa. I am sure that Kabissa members will be
relieved to be able to use it again. The work you are doing is invaluable
for African non-profits trying to take advantage of the internet, and we are
grateful to you for it.

Cheers,

Tobias

Well, tomorrow (Thursday April 5th), I shall be sending the Admin of
Kabissa a pre-release version of www4mail.

Hopefully, we can co-ordinate and work vai e-mail to bring his server back
on-line!

Thanks
Clement Onime
