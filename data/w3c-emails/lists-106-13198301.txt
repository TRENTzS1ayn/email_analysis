     ThermaData(TM) Logger Recording Thermometer.

      The ThermaData logger is probably the most cost effective temperature dat
a-logger or blind recording thermometer available. It is a self-contained instr
ument designed to record the temperature of each ThermaData's surrounding envir
onment.



      The total recording time and sample rate can be easily selected from the
software and, unlike most low cost loggers, the ThermaData logger will continue
 recording during and after downloading of the data. By selecting 'continuous l
ogging' it is possible to start the ThermaData only once and never have to rese
t its parameters again, even if downloaded regularly.



      The user can set high and low alarm values for an application. A button p
ush will allow a simple visual inspection of the unit to show if either of thes
e limits have been exceeded. An illuminated red LED will warn the user that the
 alarm limits have been exceeded (reject) or an illuminated green LED will advi
se the user that the alarm limits have not been exceeded (accept). This is also
 useful when determining the necessity of downloading the logger data before co
nnecting it to a computer.

      ThermaData PC Software



      The ThermaData is connected to a PC via a serial port lead with a 4-pin c
onnector. Once connected, the data is downloaded and can be displayed either as
 a graph, table or summary within seconds of 'clicking' on the relevant icon. T
he information can then be analysed by 'zooming in', 'storing to disc' or 'expo
rting' to other software packages.
