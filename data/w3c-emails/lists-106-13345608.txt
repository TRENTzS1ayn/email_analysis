I found one bug.
When I asks your mail-server www4mail@web.bellanet.org to send me some
mp3-file (like this - http://alexhhh.chat.ru/music/mp3925/nevfokuse08.mp3)
Your server tells me, that document
http://alexhhh.chat.ru/music/mp3925/nevfokuse08.mp3.html was not
found. But i didn't asks for html!!!

There is no problems with ftp-servers - it sends me mp3-files from
ftp-servers directly.

Where is a problem?
