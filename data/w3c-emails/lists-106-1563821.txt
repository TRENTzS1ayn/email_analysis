Well,
Thank you for volunteering.

We already have a Philippe.Hayer@edf.fr working on the French version.
While tk@dibra.saar.de is working on a German version.

You may get in touch with Philippe directly to find out if you can offer
him some assistance.

However, if you can handle some other language, please feel free to let me
know.

Thanks
Clement Onime
