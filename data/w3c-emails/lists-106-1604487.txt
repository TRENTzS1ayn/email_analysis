Dear,
Thank you for volunteering to help out.
Attached to this a zipped file containing all the files to be
translated into Simple Chinese.

Please when you have finished you can send me by e-mail a ziped file with
Simple Chinese version only.
Please add the extension .cn to each file that you translate.

A possible dead line would be about 1 week.

I would be glad to have the Simple Chinese version in about 1 week.
or earlier.

There are about 44/45 files in the zip archive.

Thanks
Clement Onime
