      ThermaDatasn Logger Now Available with PalmOSsn Softwae.







      Made  by

      ETI Limited - (U.K.)
     The ThermaData Palm software has been designed to enable ThermaData logger
 users to download data without removing the Thermadata logger from its monitor
ing position. The ThermaData Palm interface plugs into any palmOSsn hand held c
omputer's is probably the most cost effective Temperature data-logger



      Two methods of download are available. Manual download prompts the user f
or connection of the ThermaData Logger and once uploaded the data is shown on s
creen. "Auto Acquire" mode checks automatically for a connected ThermaData Logg
er. Once the upload is complete a bleep signifies the finish of the process. Th
e ThermaData Logger can then be removed and another one connected ready for aut
o detection and acquisition.



      Once uploaded from the ThermaData Logger the files can be viewed in diffe
rent formats. The summary gives an overview of the data including start and end
 dates and times, number of samples taken, alarm settings and number of alarms
that have occurred. The graph shows the data as a line graph. The zoom feature
allows the user to view down to 10 samples per screen. By tapping on a point on
 the graph the sample number, time, date, temperature value and alarm status of
 sample are displayed. The data or the alarms can be viewed as a list. User not
es can be added which are then attached to the file. "Palm Hotsync" transfers t
he data to a PC where it may be interrogated using the ThermaData Logger soft-w
are. A technical data-sheet and free demo software is available.
