No Bug here!
Did you try to read the html pages?
The remote server is requesting you to fill in your e-mail address and it
would e-mail you a URL that would allow you to download the pdf files,
otherwise you have to pay about 10$.

So, fill in your e-mail address in the htm page sent to you!

Thanks
Clement Onime
