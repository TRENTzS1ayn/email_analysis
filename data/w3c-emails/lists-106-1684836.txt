Dear Emilia,
Thank you for volunteering to help out.
Attached to this a zipped file containing all the files to be
translated into Spanish.

Please when you have finished you can send me by e-mail a ziped file with
Spanish version only.
Please add the Spanish 2 letter extension to each file that you
translate. (I am not sure what it is yet).

A possible dead line would be about 1 week.

I would be glad to have the Spanish version in about 1 week.
or earlier.

There are about 44/45 files in the zip archive.

Thanks
Clement Onime
