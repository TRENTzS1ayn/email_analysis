Hi,

as first halfth of help files is translated, I'd like to know a suitable charse
t:
   7-bit ascii, spare char pairs for 8-bit long chars, e.g. 'a diaresis' = 'ae'
   7-bit ascii, 8-bit longs replaced by html entities, e.g. 'a diaresis' = '&au
ml;'
   8-bit ascii, 8-bit longs as defined within Oberon System V4, Swiss version
   8-bit ascii, iso-8859-1
Other conventions or conversions are not available, I regret.


There seem to be (at least) two inconsistencies within help files:


\help\help.txt: "503 Error Message - Service Unvailble (quota finished)"

\conf\help.hlp: HelpMessageError503     PLEASE DO NOT MAKE ANY NEW
REQUEST UNTIL AFTER THE RETRY TIME WRITTEN AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS
PAGE

Same error number, but different text.
Or used at different times or places?


\help\help.txt: GETSIZE sets the size of the www4mail reply message in bytes (n
o other symbols are allowed)

\help\getsize.txt: GETSIZE accepts figures in bytes or with a
surfix K for kilobyte.

"no other symbols are allowed" would mean: no surfix "K", wouldn't it?
Please clarify.


If some german-speaking www4mail fan out there likes to read and
comment on translation of help.txt (command HELP), please let me know.
