great work Thomas...
Keep it up.
About the character set issues:
The file conf/interface.txt allows you to specify the character Set
against the 0: entry. This entry will be sent as the header to the user...
So, I guess, you would have to place any necessary encodings directly in
the file..

e'

help.hlp generates a short 1 or 2 line help message placed in the first
page: Usually it tries to explain more what happened.

Please use the getsize.txt file here because help.txt file is older and
thus does not mention everything (just the basics).
I think the K works!.
