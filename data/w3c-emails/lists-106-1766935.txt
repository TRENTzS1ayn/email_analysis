Well,
It is not a www4mail bug.
The remote server denies access to www4mail because it does not
like the fact that www4mail does not present a valid e-mail address (as
the password).

One solution would be to use the user's e-mail address as the password.
However, I would try to see what can be done!

Thanks
Clement Onime
