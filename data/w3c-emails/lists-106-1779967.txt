Some troubles with "getpart" option. Look through the forwarded message.
You'll see:

>user option(s): ximage getsize=290000 getpart=1

And number of part received is 9 (!). Moreover, i think, system had
posted all 11 parts simultaneusly, while only one was requested.

It's not very pleasant to pay fines for mail account overflow (1 Mb
maximum), but now I have to do this :(.  If possible, please check for
this bug.
