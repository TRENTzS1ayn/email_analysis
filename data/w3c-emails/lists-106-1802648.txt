I have noticed quiet a few references recently like the following

1)  file://localhost/subdir/index.htm

What has brought about the change?  It does make it more difficult to
send off requests, espcially when the original request was something on
the order of:

userone@com.com&USER=123456">http://mindit.netmind.com/userdefaults.shtml?USERN
AME=userone@com.com&USER=123456

and it kicks back only part of the full URL.
