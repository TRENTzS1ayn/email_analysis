Hello all,

Here is the problem.  I am trying to access the following site:

http://www.egosurf.com/

I fill in the form and send it back in.  Then the response speaks of
using the refresh button on the browser.  The site says it will take
about 15 seconds to intially fulfill the request.  I have tried the
Bellanet, Treiste, and Binky (from a different account) and all have the
same problem of no results.  Any suggestions on settings or other servers
that would work?
