Well I tried what you suggest and get an error as below:

Error 404  - Site not Found - NO DNS Entry found - The require host does
not exist
 Bad hostname 'userid:password@dmoz.org'

I have removed my acutal ID and password.  I was able to access the site
today at my
work with a browser.  You may look up my info in the logs and try it with
a "live session".
