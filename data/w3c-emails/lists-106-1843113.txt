Hi,

I requested for the URL http://www.bruceeckel.com
which I received successfully.

From that web page on selection of the
URL             :  http://www.bruceeckel.com/ThinkingInCPP2e.html

I got following information

------------------------------------------------------------------

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Apache/1.2.1
Last-Modified: Sun, 26 Sep 1999 20:08:32 GMT
ETag: "2844-10a5c-37ee7d40"
Content-Length: 68188
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html

---------------------------------------------------------------------

I assume that the html page has been acquired properly but it hasn't
reached to me
or it is otherwise some bug.

please clarify.


with affection

Padmashali
