Maybe it would be better to know what options you had enabled! It is shown
somewhere on the page!

Maybe you selected in the footer that you want only information about this
page! Or probably you have set XDOCINFO to something (over 0). If let's
say that XDOCINFO is 60000 then the server would not send you a page that
is larger than 6000 bytes, instead it sends you just the information about
the page.

However, you need to make your request again. This time try to ensure that
you don't click the "Check this to get only information on all selected
WEB Document(s)." button.


Thanks
