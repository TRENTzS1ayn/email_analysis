Hello there,

I'd like to thank you for the excellent www4mail services you provide.
I'm a regular user of your fine service.

A Question:

Would it be possible, when using the GET command, to provide the full
URL in the reference list instead of the "localhost" string. Until
shortly the full URL was given, but now I receive messages with
"file://localhost " (see appendended message). So you have to
reconstruct the original URL, which is inconvenient.

Thanks for taking the trouble!

Regards,
Frits Westra -- fwestra@hetnet.nl
