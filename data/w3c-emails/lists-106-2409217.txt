Hello,
Very nice, this www4mail, but it's a pity I can't use the checkboxes which
appear on the pages. When I check them and use the button "Get Documents",
Outlook creates a new message, with just the recipient in the "To..."
editbox.
I use (must use) Internet Explorer and Outlook.
Is this a configuration problem, or is it a bug?

With kind regards,
Edwin.
