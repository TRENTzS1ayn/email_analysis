It should be simple.

Did you request a file using the split command?
If the file was a *.zip or a *.exe then use that extension.  Let's try
this:

copy /b macvis~1.001+macvis~1.002+ macvis~1.003+macvis~1.004 macvis~1.exe

That should be all one line with a space after the '4'.
Try to execute the file either by typing macvis~1 at the DOS prompt or
use
Run from the start button.
If the file doesn't run after you try to run it in Windows then rename it
to:
macvis~1.zip
then try to unzip it.

If that doens't work you should post back with more info.
