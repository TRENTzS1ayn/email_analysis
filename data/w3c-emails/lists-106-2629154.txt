I received most parts of this transmission after 4am, but no 19, 22-24,
26,27 (which I sent a later request for with GETPART -- sometime earlier
today, after noon).  I just received this 19th part fully 19hrs after it was
sent from Trieste to Geneva.  With the internet package timeout being what
it is, I thought this was an anomaly worth reporting.  (I removed the
attachment so as not to burden your system, but is was 200k, as were all the
other packages.  Incidentally, I did not request a 200k package size; it is
my understanding the package size should have been 300k.)

I am still awaiting receipt of parts 22-24, 26-27, which will probably now
come through in the next little while.
