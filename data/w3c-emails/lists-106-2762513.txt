Dear Clement Onime,

I requested the URL http://www.musterring.de:99/cgi-bin/gewinnspiel.pl
(with some parameters) and received the error report

Error 404  - Site not Found - NO DNS Entry found - The require host does not ex
ist

I believe this is not true. Perhaps www4mail doesn't handle the ':99'.

Best regards,
Dietmar
