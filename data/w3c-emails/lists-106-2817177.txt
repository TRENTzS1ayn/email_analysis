Dear Dietmar,
www4mail handles URLs with port specifications quite well..

Unfotunately, I sent the URL below to the wm.ictp.trieste.it server and
got back a page in German.
That I guess generally means it worked okay!
What I suspect happened was that there was a name server timeout, however
the fault appears to be temporary and not related to the www4mail
software code.

So, please try again.

Thanks
Clement Onime
