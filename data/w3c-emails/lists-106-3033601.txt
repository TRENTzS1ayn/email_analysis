Hello!,

I downloaded the the MFC Programmers Source Book Thinking in C++.

I received it in eight parts, each part of size approximately 200kB.

The file names are

tica18_zip.001
tica18_zip.002
tica18_zip.003
tica18_zip.004
tica18_zip.005
tica18_zip.006
tica18_zip.007
tica18_zip.008

I don't know how to combine them and unzip.

I tried to unzip the first file using winzip7, but of no result.

Please let me know how to combine these part documents and make a valid
archive to unzip.

With regards

Padmashali
