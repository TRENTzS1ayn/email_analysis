Well,
www4mail already does background images!
www4mail can place URL link(s) for all images found in a HTML page
(including the background image) if you place the XIMAGE command before
your request. When you get a reply, then You will have to select the image
you want and request for them in another e-mail message.

If the background image is created using Javascript or something similar,
then it would not work!

Thanks
Clement Onime
