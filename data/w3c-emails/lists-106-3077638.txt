Hello,everyone! sorry to bothering you.
first,i'm very sorry for my poor english,second,i admire you for your good work
 for us.
i'm a chinese college student,begin to use www4mail system 4 weeks later,i have
 find a strange thing:everytime i get the respond mail form your server,and sel
ected the little 'checkbox' before every link,clicked the button marked with "g
et selected document(s)",i will get a respond mail reporting a error,just like
below:
--------------------------------------------------------------
Error 400  - Unknown request - This mail does not contain any valid request.

THE BODY OF YOUR MAIL WAS:


---END MAIL BODY DUMP---

------------------------------------------------------------------------

i'm using windows NT4.0 workstation+SP5 and outlook express 5.0 and internet ex
plorer 5.0 (all of them are chinese version).My mail server is running Lotus No
tes 5.0 server.

In fact when i open the mail that send to your server as a requeste of the docu
ments i selected,it is really empty.
I had tried to using opera 3.5 instead of internet explorer 5.0 to open the rec
eived web page,and selected the documents and clicke the "get selected document
s" button,the opera will send a letter out that isn't empty,but the responce fr
om www4mail server is just the same as when i send a empty request.

the resource of the mail send by outlook express after i selected some link in
the web page(it is attached by this mail)that is opened with internet explorer
and clicked the button is listed below:

the two mail above all lead to a error report(empty request) by www4mail server
.

the attachment of this mail is the web page i received from your server by send
 a mail with a body like:"http://www.xys.org".

i think this may be a bug of www4mail system or just a "bug" in result of the s
etting of my own system.i'm looking for your answer.i'm learing programming by
myself,but i hav't access to internet,i only have a e-mail account.how anxiety
i hope to get resources by your great system!
Best wish to you!
