Okay,
What happened here was that the Web Server was returning a blank URL for
a redirect request (Redirect code 302).

I spent the better part of yesterday looking at the HTTP 1.1 technical
documentation.

The good news is that it should now be working properly because www4mail
now handles redirections better...

Any other failure would be due to some other (undiscovered) problem...

Thanks

Clement Onime
BTW: www4mail@wm.ictp.trieste.it now speaks a little German... Try to
place the command XMYLANG=de before your request..
Credit for this goes to Thomas Knecht...
