The problem with Internet Explorer is know and it is possible to solve it
sometimes by using the command XBYJS.
Example
XBYJS
http://www.yahoo.com

When explorer opens the page and you click on  Get Selected Documents, it
should fill in the e-mail properly..

Also, it is now possible to use Opera on the www4mail@wm.ictp.trieste.it
server.

Thanks
Clement Onime
