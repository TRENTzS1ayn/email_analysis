Hi,

I did not find any commands which sends back requests _not_ to the
original email addreess. Is there any? (like reply-to)

I whould like to send requests through an sms-gateway from a
mobilphone and the "From:" address of my sended mail will not be a valid,
repliable address. So I ought to use a "reply-to" command.

Second thing what I'd like to know: If I can write only in a single
line (there is no "enter" button an a mobilphone), how I can separate
the URLs. Are there any character combination what the www4mail server
means for "enter"?

Thanks
grPici
