This is interesting... It only affects the GET or send commands.
The lynx software used to get the text image only showed part of the
page.. I cant seem to figure out why the lynx rendering software behaves
that way.. Probably a bug in lynx.

However, it has been fixed, you should now see the complete page.

Thanks
Clement Onime
