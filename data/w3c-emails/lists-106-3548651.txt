WELL
1. YOU COULD HAVE READ THE MAIL BODY PROPERLY
        It say "send command HELP SPLIT for help in recombining split
        messages"
 THSI MEANS YOU CAN SEND A MAIL TO THE WWW$MAIL SERVER. PLACE IN THE MAIL
BODY THE following:
help split

IT WILL SEND YOU AN E-MAIL WITH EXAMPLES

2. TRY copy/b file_ext.001+file_ext.002+file_ext.003..... file.ext

3. A GOOD PROGRAM WOULD BE UUDEVIEW, WHEN YOU HAVE THE PROGRAM, YOU CAN
FIND OUT HOW TO GET WWW4MAIL TO SUPPORT IT by sending the command
help xuudeview to the www4mail server


THANKS
Clement Onime
