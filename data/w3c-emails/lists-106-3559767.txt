Dear Clement,

In past I successfully had logged in to <http://www.onelist.com>
(a huge free mailing lists provider) using <www4mail@wm.ictp.trieste.it>.
Login (it's called "Sign In" there) requires use of cookies,
<www4mail@wm.ictp.trieste.it> has cookie support enabled
(I checked by "help info"). Recently I again tried to request
cookie-protected pages from <http://www.onelist.com> and got
invitation to sign-in. I thought that my "cookie jar" was deleted
for some reason and tried to sign-in again. My request (I masked
my password because I own a closed mailing list on ONElist and care
for privacy of subscribers):

> xnostat
> XFORM=FORM ACTION /login.cgi METHOD post

> XFORMREPLY = TEXT

I tried twice - same.

Registration on <http://www.onelist.com> is free, I never got spam from there.

Many thanks for the invaluable resource and continuous work for its
improvement!
