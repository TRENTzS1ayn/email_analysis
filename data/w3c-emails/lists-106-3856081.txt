Well,
Thanks for reporting this incidence promptly.. It was not even registered
in the logs...

It was due to the timeout procedure being called recursively...

I noticed yesterday that the system was quite busy but I could not figure
out why..
Sorry about the 100 mails, I hope it has stopped now...
