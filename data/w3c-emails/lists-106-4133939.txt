Hello:

My question:

Does anyone know why, SINCE JUNE '99, <www4mail@wm.ictp.trieste.it> doesn't
answer any of my requests/messages...not even a "help" inquiry is answered...

Is it defunct...?

Or....Does it ignore or discriminate -vs-  .net addresses???

I have tried for almost four months and I've never received a single reply
since   "Last access:   text on Fri May  7 00:48:10 1999" [[Date: Fri, 7 May
1999 00:53:19 +0200
LAST TIME trieste replied correctly).


Ever since that date, trieste has behaved "erratically".

For instance:

This is the header I received the *last time* that I sent a message to
<www4mail@wm.ictp.trieste.it>:AND RECEIVED *ANY* KIND OF REPLY  (Now I
don't receive *any* reply, not even an error message...)

And also several with this type of header:

Could someone **please** tell me  ??What is going on??

Thank you...

<hbarcena@telnor.net>

PS: I never had any problems with preceding ICTP_GETWEB
<getweb@ictp.trieste.it> until getweb service was disabled!
