Well,
The Trieste gateway does not discriminiate against anyone.

Could be that your ISP could discriminate against the Trieste
gateway....

There are a lot of users who send requests from the .net domain..
Please confirm with your ISP.
Some ISP don't configure thier mail networks to automatically retry if a
server refuses connection. So the ISP's mail server just forgets the mails
somewhere on the disk...

Thanks
Clement Onime
