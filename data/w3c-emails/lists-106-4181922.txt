ite discriminate?]


Hi Clement Onime  :-)

Sorry to bother you again  `|-/

As I said before, Yes, theoretically that *might* be the cause,  but, if
that were the case, could that ALSO POSSIBLY explain why I don"t receive
**ANY** kind of reply/message, error or otherwise (for example,:
multipart/report; report-type=delivery-status) from the Trieste gateway?

I am quite sure  it is something  new or at least quite recent, (a filter
maybe?) because  I never had this kind of problem with the Trieste gateway
before...


I am also quite sure that my ISP **does** automatically retry if a
server refuses connection. i'm sure the following header will serve to
prove that my ISP's mail server DOESN'T just "forget the mails somewhere on
the disk..."

This is the very same situation you suggest which I experienced a few days
ago (last sunday) with leucine.c.dna.affrc.go.jp [150.26.230.105])
 : (case in point:  a Deferred: Connection refused by disc.dna.affrc.go.jp.):


This is the header of the report-type=delivery-status multipart/report I
received::

(NOTE: The message eventually got through one day later and I
**DID**receive a satisfactory reply from disc.dna.affrc.go.jp)

I repeat Clement, the foregoing is proof that my ISP **_DOESN'T_** just
"forget the mails somewhere on the disk..." QUITE TO THE CONTRARY, my ISP
"Will keep trying until message is 5 days old" quote unquote...

I think the problem is something else...??could it POSSIBLY be that The
Trieste gateway ...ITSELF forgets the mails somewhere on the disk...?????"
Are you *ABSOLUTELY* sure???


Any way Clement, thank you very **VERY** much for your patience and your
help...and I would be quite grateful If you could help me resume usage of
your  great service...

Greetings  :-D
