Hi,
I like to thank You for the service that You are giving. I really
appreciate it very much and is very useful for me and my fellows.
Any way I have a couple of problems.
The first is that I do not know how can I join the binaries files
requested. Some times for the size, those files are split in several
parts and I do not what progran to use in order to bring it back to
the original form.
The second is that I do not really understand the XIMAGE
command. Please give a more readable example and the
possibilities that it give.
 Thanks for your attention in advance.

Eng. Rafael Urgelles Orue
