LS,

PROBLEM: after a request for a 1.8Mb large binary file I only received
the last parts (parts 6, 7 and 8 of 8 parts). Upon retrying with a
smaller GETSIZE value I still only got the last 4 parts of the split
binary file.
My mailserver is capable of receiving files of up to 6 MB in size, so
this should be no problem.

Did I do something wrong or is this a bug in the www4mail server?

Kind regards,

Cas van Nuenen.
