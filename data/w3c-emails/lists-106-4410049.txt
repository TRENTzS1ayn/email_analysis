Dear Sir:
        I'm appreciated to you as a user taking great advantage of WWW4mail.
        Since I can't access Internet with HTTP, WWW4mail is the only way
I access www sites with.
        Recently, I was interested with the site: http://linuxsaga.com  .

        I send the mail to your WWW4mail server with only one sentence in the b
ody below:
        

-------------cut here-------------

tsource http://linuxsaga.com

-------------cut here-------------



And the WWW4mail server return to me the result below:

------------=cut here=------------

There are only nonsense characters except two lines below in the attachmentr:

------------=cut here=------------

<!-- X-URL: http://linuxsaga.com -->
<BASE HREF=http://linuxsaga.com>

------------=cut here=------------



But the ones, who can visit http://linuxsaga.com via HTTP with netscape
or IE, told me that they can access the the whole site without any problems.
I don't know what's the matter.
Note that http://linuxsaga.com is a Chinses BIG5 and Chinese GB encoded site.

Is it a bug of the WWW4mail service?

BTW: Could you tell me some www4mail sites other than <www4mail@wm.ictp.trieste
.it>?

Thanks!

Best Wish
Yong Su
