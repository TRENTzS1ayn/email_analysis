Hello:
  Now, I use Microsoft NT 4.0 and Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.0
(all Chinese version).

  After I send a mail to www4mail@wm.ictp.trieste.it , that include
the URLs which I want get, I receive the mails which contains the
web pages. I open the attached pages, some links in the pages,and
a check-box at their left.
  I remembered that in IE 4.0, after I choose the check-box, and
press the "Get Selected Document(s)", system will give me a prompt,
and I press the "OK" button, it's OK, and I will receive the links
pages. But now whe I press the "Get Selected Document(s)", system
prompts(orignial message is Chinese,here is only English means):
"The form will be submission by email. Submission this form will
check the receiver's mail address, and send form's data in no-encrypt
status. You can continue, either or can cancel this submission".
If I choose cancel, nothing happend. If I choose continue, system
open the New-Mail window and my mail address in sender column,
www4mail@wm.ictp.trieste.it in receiver column, subject and body
all are empty, if I choose Send command, I send an empty mail to
www4mail@wm.ictp.trieste.it in fact.

Could you tell me how I can do it? Thanks!
