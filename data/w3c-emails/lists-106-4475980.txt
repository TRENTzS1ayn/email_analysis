Well,
I suspect that you may have to upgrade the some part of Windows NT.
The official Microsoft Position on this is available from
http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q179/6/11.ASP

However you try to use the www4mail XBYJS command or XJSDUMP command(s)
and enable JAVASCRIPT on the I.E browser.

The XBYJS technique uses javascript to fill in the subject line with what
should have been in the message body.
While the XJSDUMP uses javacsript to should in the browser windows that
should be in the new e-mail message, here you can then cut and paste.

Thanks
Clement Onime
