Hi,
I have sucessfully retrived some log files that you sent .
Yet, I'm not aware how to use your service. It would kind of you if
you could explain about webmail. In the mail you sent I only got the
addresses. Do I have to sent those addresses to get the pages? I'm
wondering what else can I do except sending the addresses.

Thankx
