The option given in your help file XBYJS to fill up the body of the mail
when the "Get selected Documents" is clicked does not work.  I am using IE
5.0 and mail program is Lotus Notes.  It creates a New Message form in the
Mail programe with the www4 address.   Kindly clarify as how to rectify the
problem.
