Hi friend...

sorry to disturb you....

I use microsoft outlook 97 as the mail email client.
And when I want to get the selected document from the html file that you
send, the microsoft outlook is automatically generate an email for that. But
the email doesn't contain the information for the URL.
Maybe I must set up something ... somewhere in my computer....
Wish you can help me to find the solution.....

I have no problem if I use outlook express... but with microsoft oulook  :(
...bad.


TIA
irvan
