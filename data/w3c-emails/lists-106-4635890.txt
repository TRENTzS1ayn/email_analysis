I saw your message in the www-email-discuss mailing list archive.  I
don't know if anyone answered you yet or not.

The www4mail program is, by default, configured to deny access to sex
pages.  It has a ".deny" file which prevents access to those pages.

I suspect that the authors of the program could not justify spending
university money to support access to sex pages, and so prevented it.
I also suspect that if they allowed access to sex pages, the
heavy usage would overwhelm the system.

Try again with a different subject matter and it might work - though
of course it might not be as interesting to you.
