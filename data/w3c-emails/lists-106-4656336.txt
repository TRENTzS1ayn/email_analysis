Hi, I requested a page that was recomended to me and got back that it
was forbidden. I checked with the Bellanet server and it also denies
this page.  I got it from a different service that doesn't block a lot of
stuff, and I can't figure out why.  I don't see any bad words in the text
or in the URL.
