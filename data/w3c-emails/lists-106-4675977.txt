The ".deny" file for the www4mail server lists text patterns which
are not allowed in URLs.  One of them is "*://*(hard)*.
Unfortunately, this blocks access to the name "richardbach".

Maybe the server administrator should change this.

Some of the other strings in the list also have many innocent
interpretations.
