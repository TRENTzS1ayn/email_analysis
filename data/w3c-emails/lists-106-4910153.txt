        Please, stop strange and very dangerous for me behaviour of
your server www4mail@web.bellanet.org. It sends me more than 3 days
approximately every 3 or 3,5 hours messages which I do not need. It
is the message of 3 types: empty, URL - http://www.national.com and
URL - http://www.national.com/category. May be your server can't for-
get my request which I sent to it on a previous week. But the number
of unnecesary  messages it sends to me now become dangerous for me,
because it can block my mail system. In attachment I send you 1 mes-
sage of every abovementioned types of message, which I receive.

Good luck,  Sandy.
