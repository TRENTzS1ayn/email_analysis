<<Requested (URL - http://www.finmarket.ru)>>

Dear Sir,
I am using www4mail service as I do not have online access to websites.
Big thanks to all the people who developed this service and to those who
supports its life.

But sometimes the server returns me strange error reports.
As you can see from attached messages, www4mail returned me heading page
from http://www.finmarket.ru normally, but when I requested specific
documents from this site, the machine answer was "Error 403  - Forbidden -
Access to requested page/site is forbidden"
This site is devoted to russian stock & currency exchange and has nothing to
do with adult sites.

Why the same site is in one case available, while in other cases forbidden?
(It happens with some other sites also)

Thank you,
Eugeny Sattler
