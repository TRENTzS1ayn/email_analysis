Dear Clement Onime,

thank you again for your continuous good work on www4mail.
Today I noticed a problem. I had sent an XFORM request which contained

subject=Goldene+DM+2000

as a form field among others. In the response, in the URL at "Details
for Current Page", this one form field was missing. Perhaps this might
be due to an accidental mishandling of a field with the variable name
"subject".

Best regards,
Dietmar
