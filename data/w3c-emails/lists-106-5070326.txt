Dear,

The last version of the www4mail gateways (versions 2.2 and above) have
some support for having the user interface and help files in other
languages other than english.

This means that error message and the user interface would be more useful
to more non-english speaking users!

This is a request/call for volunteers who can assist with translating the
www4mail interface into other languages.

The user interface, and help files are all available as separate files
(The size of all files is about 90K).

If you are interested in voluteering then please send a mail directly to
me (onime@ictp.trieste.it) and copy to www4mail-comment@w3.org

Thanks
Clement Onime
