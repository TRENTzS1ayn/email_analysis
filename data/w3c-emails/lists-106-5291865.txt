Dear Sir,

It seems that in www4mail@unganisha.idrc.ca help file the
ceiling for the useage of the service is set to 300, while
in reality this ceiling is set to 100. Is this originated
from this fact that I am a new user of your service or is
this just a problem of Help file no to get updated?
Regards.
Babak Aghaei
