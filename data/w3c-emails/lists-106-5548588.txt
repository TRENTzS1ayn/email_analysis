Your requested site contains one of the "banned" words, ANAL.
In general sites that contain words like anal, sex, pic(ture), babe,
naked, nude, and other words like that will be forbidden.

Not all of the WWW4MAIL servers (there are 4 now), have the same
banned list.  There are other servers that also allow you to get pages
by e-mail, some of them do ban some thing and some don't.
Get the following page:

this fellow keeps a list of servers and other usefull data.
