Dear Sir,

I used your service to get www URLs as HTML attachments in email.I received the
 page as attachment successfully and open it, when I select a link box and then
 press the "Get Selected Documents" button an outlook express new message windo
w opens that in "To" section has your www4mail address and there is no other th
ings in the subject and main section of the message.
I wonder why the HTML form doesn't submit with this email application.
I have Internet Explorer 5 and Outlook Express 5.
Please Help me.
Regards,
Hamidreza T.
