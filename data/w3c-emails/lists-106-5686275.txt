Dear Mr.:

This Monday, April 24, I try to carry out a search of a web page through the ww
w4mail server based on Trieste, but it has responded me the following thing:

<Dear User,
<
<[wm.ictp.trieste.it] Error 503  - Out of Resources (Quota Finished)
<Retry after  Fri Apr 28 21:47:37 2000
<PLEASE USE A DIFFERENT SERVER THIS SERVER HAS REACHED FULL CAPACITY of 10000 U
sers.
<
<Statistics of your (per week) usage of this service
<===================================================
<Remaining Quota : -2 request(s) or 15728640 (bytes)
<Used Quota      : 302 requests(s) or 0 (bytes)
<Last access     : html on Mon Apr 24 15:09:55 2000


I don't understand this because from the day 20 I have not used this service, a
nd that day my remaining quota was 290 requests approximately. Please, I want t
o know if there is some problem with this server or the problem is with my coun
t.
