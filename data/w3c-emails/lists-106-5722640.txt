My Dears,

At first I would like to thank you for your service. For me, who has not
Internet access at the workplace only e-mail, the only link with the
web is through web-mail servers. Thank you again!

Now, at 21 April, at www...trieste I had a quota of about 294, and, at
25 April, -3!!! I do not remember if I asked any very large doc, exe
etc. (Neither there is any copy in my folder of such an ask - I usually
archive the asks till receiving.) If 'every ask is archived', pls check
it and send me which asks used these quota.

Thank you.
