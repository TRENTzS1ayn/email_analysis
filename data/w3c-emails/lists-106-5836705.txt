Hello,

For URLs containging username and password
(in the form password@host.com/dir">http://username:password@host.com/dir...):

With XFORMREPLY=TEXT www4mail@ftp.uni-stuttgart.de gives

> Error 404  - Site not Found - NO DNS Entry found - The require host does not
exist
>  Bad hostname 'username:password@www.eScribe.com'

GET works for URLs ending by filename (for example, index.html).
For URLs without filename (ending by dirname), GET on
www4mail@web.bellanet.org gives: if URL ends with a slash - same as above,
if I omit the slash -

> URL             :  password@www.eScribe.com/life/xxxxx">http://username:passw
ord@www.eScribe.com/life/xxxxx

> Error 401  - File ACCESS Error - This file requires authorisation (login name
 and password).

SOURCE works.

Thanks,

Lena
