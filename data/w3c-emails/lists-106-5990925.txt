Yes, www4mail does not include the data section of URLs on the subject
lines, in order to keep the length small and also to hide sensitive data!
A sacn of the subject of your e-mail should not reveal submitted data.

Also, it would appear that the & sign is inter-changeable with the ? sign.
When a ? sign is missing www4mail will convert the first & sign to a ?
