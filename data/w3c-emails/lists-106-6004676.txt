Dear Clement,

thank you for the quick answer. I understand there are good reasons for
not including posted data in the subject. But: In this strange URL, the
part "&/petition/result.txt" does not belong to the data section, which
is given to www4mail as name=value lines, but to the URL itself, as you
can tell from the fact that it appears in the POST action string, which
I should have cited instead of the above:

XFORM= form method POST action "http://amnesty-caribbean.org/cgi-local/textout.
pl/petition/format.txt&/petition/result.txt"

Best regards,
Dietmar
