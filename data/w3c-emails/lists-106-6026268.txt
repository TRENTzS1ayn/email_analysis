 Hello! I have a little problem. When I get web pages through you service,
sometimes messages are split. Well I don`t limit them in size and they are
not very large. But they are splitted. And the problem is the continuation
never comes. Massage usually ends like the current one(in the bottom) Can
you help me please?
