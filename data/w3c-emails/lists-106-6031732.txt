Dear Sir or Madam:

I use outlook, outlook exepress, and Netscape Messages as E-mail program, IE
and Netscape as my browser. But when I select (one or more) buttons that
link to other Web pages, an new E-mail messages open, with only
www4mail@wm.ictp.trieste.it <mailto:www4mail@wm.ictp.trieste.it>. the
message is empty. Please tell me why it is.


Thank you

Best regards,

Gongqiu Wang
