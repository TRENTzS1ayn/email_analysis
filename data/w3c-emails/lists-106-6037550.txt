Dear service provider!

I send two mails at 2 or 3 aug. 2000, and a mail at 11 aug 2000
to the www4mail@web.bellanet.org server and I didn't get any response
about the mails, and usually I got the response in a day.

It's necessary for me because at my mail service provider's server we
have a 2Mb size and a 10 minutes/day time limitation, and with a slow
modem connection it's not so much. And if I use my mailbox as usual,
and I get the response from your server, my mailbox will brim and
I can't download my letters, so my e-mail service provider will
delete my e-mail address.

So please write me if you could that will I get the response some day
or not.

Your sincerely,
Zsolt Laposa, zslapos@freemail.hu
