Hello !

Regarding www4mail (@wm.ictp.trieste.it), I have a question :

Is it possible to get (retrieve through the www4mail-server) a password
protected webpage by providing
username and password within the URL , or any other command to the
server ?

Whenever I try to get such a page, I receive error messages like
" HTTP: Access authorization required. Use the -auth=id:pw parameter. "


Thank you,
Walter
