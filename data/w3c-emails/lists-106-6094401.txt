Dear Webmaster.

Thank very much for your web-to-mail service that is excellent for my case.

However, very often I get message: "Remote WEB Server returned Error 404" even
when I retrieve two pages within a server, at same time & I pretty sure that tw
o
these pages available (by asking my friend checking the pages with direct
access, right after receive the message)

examples:

This page with "Remote WEB Server returned Error 404"
http://www.lemonde.fr/mia/article/0,2320,seq-2030-87004-QUO,00.html

While the page below is OK

http://www.lemonde.fr/mia/article/0,2320,seq-2037-87100-QUO,00.html

Please advice me there is something I could do to avoide this Error.

Thanks in advance

Tuan Vu Duy
