Hi,

I just wanted to inform you all that I've now limited the use of the
www4mail@kabissa.org gateway to subscribers. I haven't the time at the
moment to sort out a more intelligent way to make it accessible by all - and
for now I've found that the rest of the services on kabissa.org grind to a
halt while large files are transferred via www4mail.

Is there a way to return a friendly message rather than ignoring unknown
addresses file?

Cheers,

Tobias

Sorry,
I just got round to seeing this!

There are plans to introduce https support in the near future! Probably
within a
couple of weeks!

Thanks
