Hello!!!
I am user of Collaborium, and I have a little problem.
I have two mailboxes. Earlier I was receiving documents from Collaborium to
my first mailbox, and now I want to receive messages to another box. I
changed field "Reply to", I wrote there address of my second mailbox, but
robot still sending messages to the first box. Why? What I have done wrong?
Please help me.

Electronically yours - Sergey.
