Hello,

Your service used as aggresive spam method by spamer. I received more than
100 statistic messages in day with the requirement to visit his page and to
click on banner. In this case he promises to stop dispatch spam.
I ask to stop it.

On his page is written in Russian:
If you do not want, that to you any dust should fall on a box visit
http://russkoeradio.virtualave.net and click on banner in the bottom of
page, good luck

I attached two type of his spam messages in MS Outlook 2000 format.

sorry for bad english.
