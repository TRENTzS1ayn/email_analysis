Dear comrades:

I use a lot your www4mail service, because I pay two different taxes for using
e-mail and Internet. I congratulate for such an extraordinary idea, and thank y
ou very much.

Is there anyway to get by e-mail a stream-video or stream-audio file in .ra for
mat?
If you could give me a hint, I thank you very much indeed.

Best Wishes,


Gabriel Osvaldo.
Rumania.
