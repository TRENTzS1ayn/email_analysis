Hi, guys!

Viva Italia!

(forgive me my English please!)

Today I've tried 1st time to use www4mail. I was very surprised with the
SPEEEEED and convenience of your service.

WWW4MAIL is the first FREE www-to-e-mail service I could use. All other
services became pre- or post-paid, or put a very strict limits on me, or serves
for free only in advertising order "1st time it's free".

I using a dial-up internet connection ($4 monthly payment, and $1.1 per hour
after three free hours monthly), and friend who told me about You gave me
really useful favor.

Thank you again.

But I have one question. Explain please if I can use www4mail ONLY one week, or
I may use it for "infinite" time if I don't exhaust my weekly quota. Other
words: is 300 requests/15 megabytes all what I may count on, or 300/15 is just
a weekly limit and it will be reset on the beginning of next week?

Also I have one wish. Would you ever implement searching facility? I can't pay
too much with my slow connection, but I can't avoid this waste of time. :-(
I think it may look like:

XFTPSEARCH <file name[s], may be (best choice!) with wildcards>
XHTTPSEARCH <same as above>

or just

XSEARCH <file[s]>

How about it?

BW,
Serg

p.s. If possible, I would receive an answer in Russian or in very simple
English (without any jargon except for world-wide technical terms). Please, do
not use HTML in your answer.
