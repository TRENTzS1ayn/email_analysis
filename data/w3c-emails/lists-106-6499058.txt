As I can see you have spread out attachments of mail coming to my adress. As th
e source of this is the adress www4mail-comments@w3.org, and as it now have rea
ched a public server wich I am responsible administrator of, I will have to act
ion. What it appears that you have done, is to attach files to the WAB file of
an outlook express program. I guess you have to know that this is under the jur
isdiction of virus spreading. Both in all western European countries and the Un
ited states of America this is strictly illegal. As I am the administrator of t
he computing system here, it was my duty now to scan all the systems for virus.
 I can tell you that this is not how I usually like to spend a sunday afternoon
. Especially as this has been spread by a private connection. And for your info
rmation the files you sent is detectes as virus. I do not know if you understan
d how serious this is, but the last one convicted for this act in the u.s. was
scentenced for more than ten years in jail.

This issue has now been reported to the police department, section of communica
tion crimes. As far as I know, the w3.org company will be charged in first hand
, and they will trace you up.
