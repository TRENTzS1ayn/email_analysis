Emne: SV: Violation of privacy


I was not aware of that the virus came from a list, the virus seemed to be harm
less but was not. Now I have investigated a little, and found that this virus w
as a worm. It spreads out by the wab file in outlook xpress. The reason why I a
cted like I did was because the infection came by a person who wrote to my girl
friend with the words "I know who you are, and I know where you live........."
and so on without writing his name or anything. That was the reason why I subje
cted violation of privacy.

The sender adress was www4mailing-comments@w3.org. And the virus was transmitte
d by this mail. Now I am not sure if he was innocent in the virus or not, proba
bly not, but yesterday I thought it had to be too much of a coincidence. And fr
om my girlfriends computer it was spread to the network where I am administrato
r.

The virus came in an attachment called metallica songs.pif If you get this a

I send this to the list as well, and if the person who enjoys writing such mail
s is on the list, stop such deeds, it is just as bad as anonymious phone calls
