Dear:
        I think that your problem is that you make a request by giving a
host address to www4mail server. www4mail server flter all request
that give host address and haven't a domain name. It's a police rule
that result in this error. You can send a valid domain name of server
and your request will be passed.

Good luck
Alfredo
