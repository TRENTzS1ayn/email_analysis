Thank you for giving me this nice server.
It really helps me a lot.

But....

I can not download files from ZDNet's ftp site.



1. It does not understand the URL like

http://hotfiles.zdnet.com/cgi-bin/texis/swlib/
hotfiles/downloading.html?DispCategory=Home+%2
6+Education&DispSubcategory=Grade+School&
DispTitle=Math+Snatchers&
refresh_url=ftp%3A%2F%2Fzdftp%2Ezdnet%2Ecom%2F
pub%2Fprivate%2FsWlIB%2Feducation%2Fgrade%5Fsc
hool%2Fmathsn%2Ezip&Fcode=0008NS&
Category=education&Subcategory=grade%5Fschool

Above URL is the one generated by the Form


2. Or, when I wrote down the exact URL like

ftp://zdftp.zdnet.com/pub/private/sWlIB/education/grade_school/mathsn.zip

   The request is refused saying..

   "Your terminal lacks the ability to clear the screen or position the
cursor. "



Any way around it ?


Best Regards,

Taewon Park.
