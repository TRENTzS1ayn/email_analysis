Hi!

I've been using your www4mail service for some time and it's quite handy, fast
& simple.
But there is one major inconvenience. Some other simular services (such as web2
mail)
sends back web page that I can view directly in my mailer (Outlook Express 5.5)
. Your
service sends me either HTML source (using SOURCE or XSOURCE commands) or
attached web page that I can only view with external browser (XGET). So how can
 I
receive web pages and see them in my mailer? Thanks in advance.

WBR, Alex
