Hello!

I found your address on a site about wine, food and good living. I thought that
 you will be interested by the services that our site offers.

www.wine-alley.com is a virtual Club for all those interested in wine in both a
 professional and personal capacity.

We now have more than 4300 members, both amateur and in the trade who use our s
ite to discuss wine, buy and sell it and tell us about the best sources.

Club members use the Newsgroup of www.wine-alley.com to exchange information an
d experiences.  Only the other day someone asked how much a certain rare wine w
as worth, I asked for more information about the grape variety, which doesn't g
row in France. Currently there have been more than 744 questions and replies.

There is also the small ads. column.

Among the 17 adverts placed this week there have been some really good deals in
cluding a magnum of 1945 Pichon Lalande and a 1947 Cheval blanc!

Let me make it clear - www.wine-alley.com itself does not sell or buy wine: we
simply offer our members the facilites for making their own arrangements.

www.wine-alley.com is also a site supplying information in real time, particula
rly the latest news from winegrowers and makers via the French Press Agency (AF
P).  We also have a database of more than 21,000 wines with information supplie
d directly to the site by winegrowers co-operatives and specialist magazines.

I should be delighted if you would come and join us.  At www.wine-alley.com you
 will find similarly-minded people who just want to share their love of wine.

Kind regards

François Xavier Bodin, Manager of the Online Club
