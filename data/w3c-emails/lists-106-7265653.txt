Hi www4mail supports.
Sorry for disturbing. Why www4mail don't work now (~5-8.feb.2000). I don't
know another cool servers so now I have a biiig problems ;( . But my letter
not content only from stupid complaints.
problem:
I'm from Russia. So I have another text charset, and Russian browser. My IE
write in the subject of the letter something as "Form sended from Microsoft
Internet Explorer" ...but on Russian... your server repeat this subject but
not in my charset so i have:

from: www4mail@wm.ictp.trieste.it
subject:[was
?koi8-r?B?5s/SzcEgz9TQ0sHXzMXOwSDJ2iBNaWNyb3NvZnQgSW50ZXJuZXQgRQ?xplorer.]
Requested (URL - http://wm.ictp.trieste.it)

very good isn't it?
so please can you add into your modythed HTML source something, looks like:
<form action="mailto:www4mail@wm.ictp.trieste.it?SUBJECT="WWW4MAIL
document"...> so i will recive

from: www4mail@wm.ictp.trieste.it
subject: [was WWW4MAIL document] Requested (URL - http://wm.ictp.trieste.it)
