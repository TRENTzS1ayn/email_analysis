Hi!

Seems I've found some bug in www4mail.
I've tried to get GZIP'ed file and sent
the following request:

To: www4mail@web.bellanet.org

source http://stef.u-picardie.fr/ftp/pub/mirror/RFC/rfc/27xx/2709.gz

And the result came back in a text form (not a binary attachment),
so it is not applicable... :(

Was anything wrong with my request?
Or is there any way to force www4mail
to send file as a binary?

Thanks for your time
Andre
