  Dear administrators of www4mail service!

For several month i have been used your server, and it is the best mail system
I`ve ever used.

But I have a little problem: I recived the parts of long file, used DOS`s comma
nd "copy" to concat them but obtained a negative result. How can I solve this p
roblem?
