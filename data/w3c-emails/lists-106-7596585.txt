  Dear administrators of www4mail service!

I recieved mail from you but there was not answer on my question.

I have a little problem: I recived the parts of long file, used DOS`s command "
copy" to concat them but resulting file (exe) had errors and didn`n exequted. H
ow can I solve this problem?

And I have another question. Can I use search engines via your service?
