Dear Sir or Madam,
On Mon Feb 21, I requested the file
<http://www-lfg.stanford.edu/bresnan/Book/book2.ps> by email.
But I only received 7 out of the 16 parts of the file. The parts
I received are 1, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, and 15 (each 204800 bytes).
I wonder how I can get other parts of the file.
Best,
Ahmad R. Lotfi.
