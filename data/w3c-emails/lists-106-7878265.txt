I personally have had this happen with one of the other www4mail
servers.  I have also seen other complaints on the ACCMail list and
on the Help-Net list.  It seems to derive from an error in or with the
message.  The url that I got gave an error response from the www4mail
server.  It did cause the quota to be used as well.

I mentioned it on the list and got little notice.
