I requested

http://freeload.homestead.com/_ksi0701961560927423/theanomaly/files/pgq_theanom
aly.zip

and received a message with


HELP TIP:       For more information send the command "help error"

and at the end the line

Code 200 - OK

as well as three messages with data:

ad.homestead.com/_ksi0701961560927423/theanomaly/files/pgq_theanomaly_zip.001)

.homestead.com/_ksi0701961560927423/theanomaly/files/pgq_theanomaly_zip.003)

ad.homestead.com/_ksi0701961560927423/theanomaly/files/pgq_theanomaly_zip.002)

After decoding, parts 1 and 2 are 204800 bytes long, part 3 is 153028 bytes
long, giving a total length of 562628 bytes. However, the original file is
actually 4223558 bytes long. It would be better if www4mail could give an
error message instead of sending a truncated file without comment.

Best regards,
