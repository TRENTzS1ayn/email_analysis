Sorry, URL you've used seems to be incorrect.

As you state correctly few lines above, content is 383 bytes long.....

>Please do look in to the problem.

Please look into those 383 bytes,
they could have told you, that the URL you've sent
seems to have ended with ".htms".

Just to show you, that the problem you're complaining
is looking to be independent from the used webmail server:
Request for "http://www.timesofindia.com/today/updates.htms"
sent to <gomail@ncc.go.jp> was indeed giving back:

|<TITLE>Not Found</TITLE><H1>Not Found</H1> The requested object does
|not exist on this server. The link you followed is either outdated,
|inaccurate, or the server has been instructed not to let you have it.


Try ".htm" instead.
