Good morning,

I am afraid I feel a little doubty about some points concerning the forms
sent by www4mail. In fact, when clicking on the "Get selected document(s)"
button, there is a message on the status bar of Netscape 1.22, but after
that nothing happens.

So, I had a look inside the source.

The less problematic point concerns the aspect. Script instructions are
supposed to be enclosed as comments, so that browsers like mine that do not
recognize it, do not display it.

The source would appear like this :
<!--
<SCRIPT>
 (here the script)
</SCRIPT>
//-->

This way it looks fine, but nothing comes back.

By changing the destinee mail address to mine, I could have a look at what
was sent.

The sent message begins with this :
XBASE=%22&XGET=

So it appears that the URL is forgotten.

If I make no mistake, %22 is supposedly a quote, in the source file it is
represented by "&#34" in "name = XBASE value = &#34". The problem is that
what comes afterwards is split.

In fact, this quote is not mandatory, a manual query without it returns the
requested web page. When suppressing the quotes, I obtain the URL in the
mail message performed.

Unfortunately, your server still sends nothing.
I still have to replace "&" by a line return, (I did it in the mail
directly) and to limit the query to five URLs, and after that I obtain the
pages.

I hope this helps,
Yours faithfully.
