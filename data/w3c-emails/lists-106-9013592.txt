Excuse me, Thomas, but you didn't mean

XFORM= form method "http://www.rossmann.de/cgi-bin2/TKQuestGame.pl" POST action

did you? In fact, POST is the method, and the URL is the action. I am
using it all the time this way, and most of the time it works. By the
way, you quoted my example incorrectly - the URL was on the same line
that started with XFORM=. Thank you anyway for replying.
