Dear Administrator!

    Firstly,I should thank you for your good free service.
    But now I have a trouble with your system!
    Once I asked for an URL using "TSOURCE http://www.langa.com/newsletters/200
0/jan-27-00.htm"(it's sure!),but your returned email show the URL as "http://ww
w.langa.com/newsletters/2000/jan-27-00.htm=20",so I can
t' get what I need because of your added "=20".What's the problem?
    Another similar situation was happened when I asked for the URL "http://www
.ccw.com.cn/99/tips/class.asp?class=3",the returned URL turned to "http://www.c
cw.com.cn/99/tips/class.asp?class=3D3".Then How can I get a webpage with such p
arameters?

                                                            Yours Sincerely
                                                                    Lujiang
