I think I found approximately where the problem is. In
www4mail:combine_split_lines there is code with the comment

#Now Test for Long lines ala lynx

which joins lines if the first is longer than 75 characters and the next
contains a percent sign. This was the case with my request. I don't know
what the purpose of this coding is, but obviously it messed up my
request so that it couldn't be fullfilled correctly.

Dietmar
