Hello!

It appears that www4mail doesn't handle forms with field names which
contain '+' characters correctly, e. g. "strak+e+nr" or "plz+ort" as in

http://world-of-cheats.de/verlosung2.html

I sent requests with

strak+e+nr=...
plz+ort=...

as well as

stra%DFe%2Bnr=...
plz%2Bort=...

and always received the reply from the form processing script

The following fields were left blank in your submission form:

      strak+e+nr
      plz+ort


Saluton!        Dietmar P. Schindler
