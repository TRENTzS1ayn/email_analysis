Hello,
I don't know you but I want to give my thanks, deeply from my heart!
I'm a young Persian researcher , and don't like to waste your time by talking m
uch.
As you know, here is very restricted and Your service is a really great for me
because we don't have access to Web sepecially a reliable access. I like to do
something for you but what is available except appreciation and Thank?
I hope you the best.

Regards,
Cyrus




And a little problem:
There is a problem that I didn't find any thing  about 3D inserted automaticall
y in user options when returning by GetSelectedDocuments. It some times causing
 errors.
