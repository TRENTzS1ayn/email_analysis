  Hello.

    I want to tell about the bug.
    Some time I don't receive sites or files, that I am order.
    For example: I am write a letter whith request (e.g.
  http://www.admiral.ru/~dvm/Dvmdial.zip), but this file don't come to
  me. Also I don't receive letter whit errror report (if this file was
  inaccessible or I am write wrong URL).
    It seems, that requests somewere disappear.
    If you want, I describe my problem in detail.


    May I look on my log file?



                                              WBR  Kostya.
