Dear Sir,

Recently I have downloaded a zip file which is about 4Mb. www4mail have
separate into two file while sending to me. I receive filename_zip.001 and
filename_zip.002

Well, I notice that *.001 file is a corrupted file.

I confirm this after I join the file together using the copy /b command and
Unzip program also report a corrupted file.

So could you please check at your ends for this matter.

Hope to receive your reply soon.


Regards,
Steve.
