# Hello,Bellanet.org
# Your service is GREAT!
# But... Please unscramble me,where is a mistake in THIS my request?
# I know where!
# You don't like word "SEX"
# Please,teach your software to distinguish SEX as porno and as DB field.
# Here SEX is DB field name. Site creators make up it.
# SEX=0 -> man SEX=1 -> woman
#
# THERE IS NOT PORNOGRAPHY REQUEST
# IT'S JUST JOB ADVERTISEMENT!
