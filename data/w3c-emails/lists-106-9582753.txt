Hi!  I requested from you some URLs and for 2 days I keep receiving the same du
plicate replies, filling up my Inbox and using up my www4mail quota.  This  _He
alth_.html (22.6k) I got at least 11 same copies (3 yesterday.  at least 8 toda
y)
Similar duplicates were got for other requested URLs. Please correct this bug q
uickly!

The same bug occurred with www4mail@ftp.uni-stuttgart.de  one month ago.

Thanks for your good services!
