I have followed your advice re. subj. & am recieving the requested web page as
an
attachment but sadly when I click to view the attachment my browser is activate
d & the
attachment is displayed in .htm format.  Earlier using this technique the docum
ent used to be
visible as a complete web page.  Why this change ?
Can you please also tell me in more detail how to obtain the interest messages
from the
attachment mentioned above using the `Get Selected Document(s)' button at the f
ooter of
the Web page?
