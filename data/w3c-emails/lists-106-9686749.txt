Given that WWW4MAIL uses lynx as its "engine" is there some
way to escape the & and ? characters that frequently appear in
URLs?

For example:
http://www.promedmail.org:8070/promed/promed.searchhtml.showmail?p_filename=200
00608.2403&p_year=2000&p_month=06

Without escaping [&?], WWW4MAIL returns,

   URL             :  http://www.promedmail.org/promed/promed.wwv_me
                           dia.show?p_type=plsql&p_id=754&
                           ;p_currcornerid=1&p_language=us

   HELP TIP:       Try our new help system send the command "help index"

   Remote WEB Server returned Error 404

and lynx returns:

   % lynx http://www.promedmail.org:8070/promed/promed.searchhtml.showmail?p_fi
lename=20000608.2403&p_year=2000&p_m
   [3] 20717
   [4] 20718
   lynx: No match.
   p_year=2000: Command not found.
   p_m: Command not found.
   [4]    Exit 1                        p_year=2000
   [3]    Exit 1                        lynx http://www.hsph  ...
   <...>


Many users of our www4mail program don't understand UNIX and
wouldn't know to escape [&?] with "\" when typing in a URL.

Thanks.
