Hello,

It seems that www4mail (I use www4mail@ftp.uni-stuttgart.de) has certain
problems with addresses that contain
the & (ampersand) character. It seems to truncate the address at the first
ampersand char.

I requested a page with the following command:

    tsource
http://stats.distributed.net/rc5-64/tmember.php3?team=17608&source=y

but what I received was the following document (also a valid address):

    http://stats.distributed.net/rc5-64/tmember.php3?team=17608

that is, the address was truncated at the ampersand. I tried the same
address with an Agora
server (e-mail address: "agora@dna.affrc.go.jp", the command was
"source
http://stats.distributed.net/rc5-64/tmember.php3?team=17608&source=y"), and
it
sent the correct document, so the address must be OK.


Regards,
Arpad Biro
