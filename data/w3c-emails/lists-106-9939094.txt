Hi: I´ve got some problems getting web pages through e-mail.
I received this message:

Not Found
The requested object does not exist on this server. The link you followed is
either outdated, inaccurate, or the server has been instructed not to let
you have it.

I suspect that this has something to do with the fact that I've updated my
outlook express. I have now Outlook Express 5. But I don't have conection to
the net at all. I only have e-mail.

Please, tell me what can I do.

Regards,

Noel
