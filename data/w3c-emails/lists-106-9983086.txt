Dear www4mail,

        Thanks for the neat service.  I'm having difficulty submitting
forms.  When I receive a form via email it comes in web page format
and I access it using Netscape browser software off line.  I'm
expecting to see a send button but I don't see it.  When I press the
get document button, sometimes I get a message that the form is
being submitted via email (since I'm off line I'd like it to be queued)
but nothing seems to happen.   I use Pegasus for my email.  I've
installed simple MAPI.  It'd be great to use the forms and just press
a button.  Text mode is a bit complicated.

Thanks a lot,
