What I know of TrueDoc is what I learned from a Bitstream representative at
Seyold in Boston, and what I saw with my own two eyes. The quality was akin to Type
1, which in my oppinion is not very good for text screen sizes.

 Like I said before, you can either create outlines based upon raster bitmaps,
or you can create them by converting or massaging the existing outline data. You
didn't answer which TrueDoc does. This last spin suggests you create outlines
from bitmaps, which are the "results of executing the program". Could you please
confirm or deny this?

I am in favor of a method which guarantees that the viewer of my documents sees
precisely what I saw when I created it. So in that sense I want it to be
lossless. Whether that means full or partial embedding, or the distribution of
bitmap images, or some other method not yet discussed is still up for debate in
my opinion.

I see no panacea out there, and I have yet to come to my own conclusions as to
what the best approach is. That is why I am raising these issues in this forum.

I understand the proper use of Fontographer, and I realize that the above
example is unethical and illegal. I want to know how TrueDoc is different from
this. Are you saying that if Fontographer compressed and encrypted as it
converted, I could now use that ethically and legally to distribute fonts on the
web?

Isn't the entire purpose of such a forum to educate oneself as well as one
another? I have expressed my reservations and misgivings about this technology,
in the same way that you have praised and promoted it. I simply want to work
through the possible solutions like everyone else who subscribes to this list.
The conversation so far has not done much to eleviate my concerns. But I'm still
listening...
