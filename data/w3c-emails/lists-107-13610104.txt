We provide data in several languages such as english, polish, and russian 
and install the necessary fonts on our clients' systems (running ns 
2.02).  We would like to encode our documents of another language in a 
way that changes the font or the character set automatically without 
having to switch to options, etc.  Actually, I believe that we would want to 
change the character set.  Can anyone comment on this?  

Some of these languages that we would be supporting are not supported 
directly by ns2.02, they would have to be user defined.  Is it still 
possible to automate the switching of the fonts/character sets?

I've seen the META tag around as follows - does it work?
<META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="Text/Html; Charset=iso2022-jp">
Im assuming that iso2022-jp is japanese, where can i find the codes for 
polish or russian?

Thanks in advance for advice on this important issue.
