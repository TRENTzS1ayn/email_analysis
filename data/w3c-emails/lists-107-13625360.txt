Definitely the "charset", which is a well used but very inappropriate
name in MIME to denote encodings of characters. Please don't use
fonts to switch between different encodings, it might work in some
cases, but will give you big headaches in the future.

Yes, this is correct, and it works on Netscape (and a few other
not so well known browsers). Ideally, this information is sent
in the HTTP header, and not as part of the document, because
there are "charset"s where it is impossible to understand that
tag inside the document.

It may be nice help to the user that Netscape supports
x-mac-ce, but please help everywhere to do what fortunately
has worked for Western Europe, namely that only one single
encoding (i.e. "charset") is used. Different platforms currently
still use different local encodings, but for the web, it does
not help to just use your local "charset", or the one you
think might be most popular on target machines. The only
good solution is to stick to very few widely usable sets.
For Central Europe, this clearly would be iso-8859-2, as
it is iso-8859-1 for Western Europe (you don't have to
indicate this, as it is the default).
Ideally, in the future, there will be even less "charset"s,
if everybody is moving towards Unicode.

They should be supported by both of them. But please use
iso-8859-2 for wide compatibility.

The number of "charset"s that Netscape is supporting is increasing
with every version, maybe more than necessary. But definitely, they
should add iso-8859-5, and if you can convince them that you have
a wide enough market, I guess they might even make a special version
for you. While it is very difficult for an outsider to add an encoding,
it is rather easy for them, especially if the underlying OS already
supports it, which I assume is the case for you users.

<<--wants to know the charset names for MS Windows and Unix...

For the web, using "charset"s proprietary to some system is the
wrong thing to do. Please use only widely accepted and standardized
"charset"s, which means mainly the iso-8859-x series and some
others.
