Dean,

I have received you posting about FONTS.
We have already done the job, we added complete
FONT and vector graphics management to WEB
publishing.
I suggest two things:
Subsribe our : WEB Typography digest

and take a look at our site how it works.
DOWN LOAD : WEB BUSTE.EXE a free graphical
broeser, install it and come back. (don't forget to check
automatic font download from the option menu)
or if you prefer, use EPUBVIEW.EXE a plug in to
NETSCAPE or Explorer browser.

Regards 
Laslo
