John,

Theoretically, WEB BUSTER  and EPUB has to work with WABI
Download it and try it.
How you make your money? Are you on the WEB?

 |and take a look at our site how it works.
 |DOWN LOAD : WEB BUSTE.EXE a free graphical
 |broeser, install it and come back. (don't forget to check
 |automatic font download from the option menu)
 |or if you prefer, use EPUBVIEW.EXE a plug in to
 |NETSCAPE or Explorer browser.

Unfortunately I'm stuck with UNIX (although I do have 
Wabi -windows emulation- that runs on my Solaris2.5 box) 

-- you don't have anything for me, eh?

Thanks,
