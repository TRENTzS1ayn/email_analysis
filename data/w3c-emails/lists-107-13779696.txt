Paul Haeberli's proposal for a simple bitmap font format is
interesting (I've used the even simpler version in the pbm toolkit),
but I feel it is not good enough. The fonts may produce acceptable
results on a screen, especially if PNG's ability for alpha channels is
used for anti-aliasing, but it is not good enough for printing.

A mature font format should provide for kerning, ligatures, and
resolution independency. There must be a standard way to map the
glyphs to Unicode characters. And on the Web, it should also be free
(at least the decoding software).

Defining a new format is a lot of work. It can be done when needed (as
was PNG for bitmap graphics), but maybe there already is a format we
can use. I know of Postscript, TrueType, MetaFont, BDF/PCF, and
TrueDoc[2]. Before designing a new format, I want to be sure that none of
these meet the requirements.
