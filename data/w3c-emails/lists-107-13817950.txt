Is there a free implementation of a trutype rasteriser? If not, that
would seem to make it less than optimal as a choice for distirbuted
font technologies.

The idea I had was to make fonts available in a variety of formats,
with the servers all being able to generate, at a minimum, a 64x64
bitmap.
