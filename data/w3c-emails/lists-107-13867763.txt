More so than other vector formats such as Trutype, Adobe Type 1?

are you alluding to problems with one of the other suggestions? I don't 
think Adobe Type 1 has any problems as long as you call it 
ISO/IEC 9541-3: 1991

Perhaps we could compile a list of possible formats and the platforms
that can handle each, plus the availability of export options to that
format from font design applications and any other considerations such
as availability of hinting and so on.

That is a separate issue, as far as I can see.

That is one way. Conversion is another. If a platform already has high 
quality rendering code it seems pointless to duplicate it.

Your description was fine, although there seems to be a trend for servers
to advertise what they have in stock rather than for clients to enumerate
everything they can handle.

What is missing from your description, and the much harder part, is
avoiding the single point of failure, and handling payment and
licensing.
