The biggest problem with metafont is that you cannot pull a single
glyph definition out of it, send it across the net, and expect it to
work. For very large fonts, sending individual glyphs will be
necessary. 

On the other hand, if a metafont *server* rasterised the glyph, and
sent back a *bitmap*, the problem goes away.
