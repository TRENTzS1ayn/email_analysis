I wonder if Ares Software would care to use their font descriptor technology?
I pulled this excerpt from an article on AOL in their MDP forum:

  FontChameleon from Ares Software (415/578-9090) offers the ability
  to manipulate the master fonts in applications that have QuickDraw GX
  slides for weight, height and width.

  Future versions of Apple's operating system and printers will further
  integrate and tweak Quickdraw GX. Upcoming OS's will also use
  Ares Software's Chameleon technology. Used in the FontChameleon
  application, Chameleon automatically generates TrueType and Postscript
  Type 1 fonts from master outlines and preset descriptor files. Combined
  with Quickdraw GX, Chameleon should offer enhanced document portability,
  and better font selections and type effects, requiring minimal RAM and
  disk space.

The font descriptor files are very small (2-3K).
Ares is best known for their "FontMonger" PS/TT converter.
