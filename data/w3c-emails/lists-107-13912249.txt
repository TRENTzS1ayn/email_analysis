That's right, although it could be used to produce font files in an 
outline format. Its primary usefulness, however, is the ability to 
produce high-quality bitmaps at a variety of resolutions.

On the contrary, I think a high-quality scalable format is exactly what 
is needed in this context, although we may want to store both metafont 
and compiled bitmap forms of the font on the web server, and let 
client-server negotiation be the deciding factor.
