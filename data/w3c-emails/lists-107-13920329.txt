I definately agree that having a scalable representation is
a good thing, but spline polygon formats are what current 
designers are using to generate typefaces, not METAFONT 
paths and brushes.

I agree that METAFONT fonts can be converted into spline or 
polygonal outlines, but converting spline outline fonts
into the METAFONT model is somewhere between very difficult
and impossible.

If you want a scalable font technology. I suggest spline
outlines.  Since you can't convert nice spline fonts into
METAFONT format, I would not recommend using it as a font
format on the web.

As for legal problems using Type1 or Truetype format.  I 
don't think there are any.  Adobe and Microsoft wouldn't 
mind if you decided to use Type1 ot Truetype.  They would
love it.
