     David and Hussein,  I'm running out of gas so this will be my last 
     entry this evening. I will try to complete the remaining topics

     Hinting:
     Yes, hinting is very difficult, and implemented differently depending 
     on the format. Most fonts require a good set of hints below 60 pixels. 
     Hints maintain the uniform stroke thickness, uniform character 
     heights, and baseline references, side bearings, ect..... and allow 
     for hours of stress free reading.
     
     Allowing designers to choose any font format combination for authoring 
     and maintaining the original font fidelity is almost an impossible 
     goal and this is achieved by using TrueDoc. TrueDoc has a unique 
     automatic hinting process which is applied to the character shapes 
     during the authoring process. The results of the TrueDoc character 
     recording process are excellent and can only be improved upon by font 
     designers hand tuning for discrete point sizes.
     
     In addition to TrueDoc's excellent auto-hinting process, our OEMs and 
     ISVs also can make use of TrueDoc's anti-alias modules that deliver 
     grey scale bitmaps during the rendering process.
     
     Bitmaps can be delivered which are 32K pixels high. Rendering speed of 
     bitmaps for screens are in the range of 400 to 500 characters per 
     second on a 486/66. Once generated and cached, the performance is 
     limited mostly by the blit operations.
