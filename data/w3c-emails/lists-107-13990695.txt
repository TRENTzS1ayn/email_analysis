        There are three components to the Ares solution as I understand. There 
is a master font which is quite large, the morphing control logic which 
generates the font descriptors (2-3kb) and the rendering logic. The rendering 
logic takes the font descriptors and the master font(very large), and renders a 
font image. Designers and publishing software use real fonts to publish, not the
chameleon fonts.... I don't know if designers will ever part with the font they 
use.... Try looking at Bitstream's TrueDoc http://www.bitstream.com/

Sorry Walter,
     
My hands are tied.  I can't subscribe or offer any services, until  Ares cuts 
through the red tape of getting on the WWW.
