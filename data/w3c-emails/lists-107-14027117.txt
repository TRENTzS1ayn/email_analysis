Kevin,  
Bitstream also has been working in the Java area. We have been working on a very
high quality scalable solution called TrueDoc. (visit www.bitstream.com). The 
first Java fix we did, was to allow the access to all fonts located on your 
local machine rather than the 4 hard wired Java fonts. Some of this work was 
done in support of Future Tense. They have a great publishing and viewing 
product called Texture, completely written in Java. TrueDoc is also built into 
Texture. We are working fast and furiously at making TrueDoc the scalable font 
transport and imaging engine for the Web. We will be showing TrueDoc and several
implementations at Boston Seybold in two weeks.
