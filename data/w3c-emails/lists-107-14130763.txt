We have done a review of both approaches that compete directly with Bitstream 
TrueDoc technology. In general Microsoft's proposal is TrueType centric and 
Adobe's is somewhat Postscript centric. TrueDoc is absolutely neutral in that it
handles both formats, is platform independent and is available now. Hakon, I 
would like to have a BOF meeting at the Paris conference in May regarding 
transport of fonts, how they are referenced, imaged, and printed. I willing to 
set up the meeting an work on this. Could you indicate how to proceed?
  There is also information on each font proposal at  http://fonts.verso.com/

I have linked this press release, along with the one from Microsoft, 
from [1]. It seems that the two announcements complement each other, 
and this is a good chance to work together to find a common font 
solution for the web.
