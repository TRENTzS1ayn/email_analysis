Speaking as a designer, producer and user of type, I have some concerns about a
technology such as TrueDoc. As I understand it (and no doubt someone will
correct me if I'm wrong) TrueDoc converts each font into a new proprietary format
which allows for easy compression and transmition. At the other end, the font is
reconstituted and "autohinted" thus reestablishing some level of screen quality.

While this scenario may produce satisfactory bitmaps in many cases, it will
certainly fail for a significant portion of the fonts in the marketplace today. In
particular, any TrueType font which has been extensively tuned to provide
optimal screen bitmaps will be in jeopardy when TrueDoc is used to convert and
compress it for use on the Web. 

How confident can a Web publisher be that the reader will see the same thing as
he/she is designing on the Mac or PC which is on their desktop.
