Hakon,

I think a Developer's day session and/or a BOF on Web fonts would be useful
addition(s) to the May W3C conference program, and Adobe would definitely
like  to participate. Fonts in HTML is certainly the immediate concern, but
from our perspective fonts on the Web is also a broader issue, touching on
Java, formats for dynamic media, etc.

In line with earlier comments on this list, we (Adobe) believe that the
Microsoft proposal and the Adobe/Netscape/Apple proposal will be
complementary (actually, our proposal is a functional superset of
Microsoft's). No one wants another "font war". More details on this to
follow soon, I hope. But, given that things might not be totally settled by
May, I might suggest that the session organizer if possible be a neutral
party, perhaps someone with a background in Web publishing, rather than one
of us folks who are promoting a specific solution.
