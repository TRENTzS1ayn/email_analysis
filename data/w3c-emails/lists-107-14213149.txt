     how do I print a Japanese web page on my HP laserjet printer?
     I presume I need to download some Japanese fonts; Does anyone know of 
     a good site on the web that provides Japanese printer fonts (including 
     kanji) for downloading? I have used the usual Web search engines but 
     none of the links that I followed up were useful.
     
     Thanks.
     S. Baig
