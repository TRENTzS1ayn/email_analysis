     If you can see the kanji characters on your screen, setup the printer 
     to print "Fonts as Graphics". Most North America printers will not 
     accept a kanji font. There are so many restrictions between the 
     applications, drivers, and printers -- graphics mode is the best.

     how do I print a Japanese web page on my HP laserjet printer?
     I presume I need to download some Japanese fonts; Does anyone know of 
     a good site on the web that provides Japanese printer fonts (including 
     kanji) for downloading? I have used the usual Web search engines but 
     none of the links that I followed up were useful.
     
     Thanks.
