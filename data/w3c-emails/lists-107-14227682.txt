I am a CGI developer with limited font experience, but I've done my 
homework and still cannot find a way to specify that the option lines of a 
HTML form Select input are displayed in a fixed font (I am trying to display 
concatenated database fields in a line.  Am I missing something or is this 
yet another problem left to the current "font wars"?  Thanks for any help!
