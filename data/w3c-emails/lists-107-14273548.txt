72dpi is actually what the MacOS is designed with.

"oops" is right -- I hardly think we Mac folks are a minority -- there are
millions of us using the Web, and I don't know how many thousands of
*servers* on the Web are Macintoshes...perhaps Quarterdeck (which bought
StarNine which bought WebSTAR which used to be called MacHTTP) has some
idea... :-)
And as a ratio of internet usage to installed base, the number is 3 times
as high for Macintosh as it is for Windows. Sure it's a smaller total
number, but it's a higher ratio, and that's gotta count for something...
;-)

Many of us yearn for that day...  ::pant,pant::
I'm a Type 1 kinda guy myself. Haven't installed QD GX yet, but I sure hope
that GX is ported to Windows by the time Copland comes out, since Copland
has GX built in. Eeek.
