The plea is actually at the URL:

   http://www.letterror.com/pixels.html

The document argues that pixel fonts are needed, but has no technical proposal
as to how this might be done.

The issues of adapting to different display densities and the overhead of
transmitting the same font rasterised at different sizes are also not
adressed.

Is it planned to develop this plea into a substantial technical proposal? I
would be interested to see it.
