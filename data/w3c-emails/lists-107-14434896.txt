     Erik, 
     There is a market for pixel based fonts within memory constrained 
     devices, however.....  For collaborative documents the world went with 
     scalable type already for products like Envoy and Acrobat. The web 
     already makes use of scalable fonts by referencing the FONT-FACE= tag 
     like in Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator. I is almost 
     impossible to move towards bitmaps again.

Not since I made my comments. I see from your document:

The main substance of the argument seems to be not that pixelfonts are 
good, but that outline fonts on the Web are bad. You seem to take the 
position that outline fonts should only be used by phototypesetting 
bureaux, everyone else should use bitmaps to ensure that they don't 
copy outline fonts.  So you don't much care to define what pixelfonts 
might mean or how they might be used, just that people shouldn't use 
outline fonts on the Web.
     
Would that be a fair summary?
