I'm not so sure that this is such a big threat.  Professional 
publishers and designers will buy legitimate typefaces;  fonts
reconstituted from documents would be likely to have missing characters,
hinting problems and such and thus to be too much hassle to justify
using them.  Also, in most countries, organisations such as FAST can raid 
and audit workplaces to ensure that all the software being used is 
legitimate; there is no reason why this cannot be extended to fonts.
Finally, one of the things one pays for when buying software of any
sort is a relationship with the publisher.  This is less so for fonts,
because they require less maintenance, but is still a factor.

Anyone can theoretically make a second-rate outline font from a 
PostScript file;  but then again, anyone can also scan in a 
printed font and make a knock-off font, which is perfectly legal in
the US as long as they change the name.  And yet professional 
publishers and designers still buy original fonts.

That is an idea; mind you, a corpus of "free" (subsidised) fonts for
online publishing is not always the answer.  What if a site needs to use
a particular font which is not free?
