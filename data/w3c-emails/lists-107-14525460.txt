But if they use it in a professional environment, they open themselves
up to prosecution for software theft.  And doing so is a major 
liability and Not Good Business.

How many of these pirated copies actually compete against legitimate
copies in the marketplace, as opposed to lying around on a pack-rat's
hard disk?  I suspect that most "font collectors" who swap fonts with
friends are not in the publishing or design business and would not
buy fonts in the first place. (That is not to say that they do no wrong;
if the latest design ends up on lots of two-bit newsletters, its image
becomes less valuable more quickly than it otherwise would.)

And if SPA and FAST don't worry about font piracy, perhaps various 
type foundries should form their own organisation that does.

Aren't most of them dodgy TrueType knockoff fonts of the "1,000 fonts 
for $19.95" variety?

Possibly.  But then again, bitmap fonts are tightly wedded to a resolution
and are not easily portable.  X11 assumes 75 or 100 dpi, 
Windows assumes 96 and the Mac assumes something like 72.  This 
complicates things.  

That is not to say that bitmap fonts don't have a use; they probably do,
in graphics and headings.  But they're not much good for displaying text
portably.

The problem with precautions is that to be secure, they would depend on
proprietary formats, a concept which is opposed to the principles of
HTML and open systems.  The browser will need a key for decoding the font
to display it; however, if the user can obtain the key, e can rip the font.

To keep up appearances.  While the average Joe Sixpack may be satisfied
with poorly proportioned knockoffs obtained by the hundred on CD, 
professional designers would not.  And there is an evident difference
between the appearance of professionally designed documents and those
knocked up at home by an amateur.  In either case, professional type
designers get very little money from such amateurs, whether because of
knockoffs or piracy.  Professional fonts are somewhat of a prestige market.

Yes;  if fonts are subsidised by companies and made available for free
online use, they should be those which are sufficiently generic that,
while they add to the range of typographical expression, they do not 
give away anything new.  Times and Helvetica would be the most obvious
candidates (indeed, I believe Microsoft have licenced the TrueType versions
of their lookalikes, Times New Roman and Arial, for web use).
