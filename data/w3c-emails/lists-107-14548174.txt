Provided the server was able to generate the requested fonts at the requested
color and resolution. This would impact latency a little, and would also impact
cacheing performance somewhat.

Treating a pixel font (or an outline font rendered with anti-aliasing) as
an alpha channel rather than as image data has interesting possibilities,
such as true antialiased text of any color on any color background, or
foreground images on display type.

Yes, the keepalive could be used for that. Then again, one could define a
pixelfont format that puts all the images in one file, either using a format
that can contain multiple independent pictures, using a large image with the
letters aranged on a grid, or even using a MIME multipart to batch up the
individual letters.

It is interesting to study the proposed alIG (alignment) chunk for PNG,
which seems to cater for precisely this:

Not just Opentype, any font which is used on the Web must adress these
concerns. There is a balance to be struck between hindering legitimate use and
hindering illegitimate use; just a s there is a balance to be struck by font
vendors between focussing on a small number of phototypsetting bureaux and a
large number of Web site authors as potential markets.

Both bitmap and outline fonts can be rendered badly, or rendered well. I agree
that bitmaps fonts require extra information in the request (display density,
primarily, plus whether it really is monochrome or whether it has contone
capability (greyscale or color)).

That seems to be an important requirement, as print-on-demand shops that
generate 'books" of printed and bound document sets looks like a growth area.

If a proposal for pixel-based fonts was presented which addressed these various
issues and was technically sound, I for one would certainly listen. I am the
chair of the W3C Fonts Working Group, by the way.
