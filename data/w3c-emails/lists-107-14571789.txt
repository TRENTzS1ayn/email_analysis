This kind of antialiasing of any colour text on any background (plain
colour or multicolour bitmap images) is technology already deployed in
some OSes - it works superbly for me on my machine (Acorn Risc PC) and
the quality of rendering is extremely good.  You should be able to buy
a NetStation within a couple of months which contains this technology
and see it for yourself (http://www.acorn.co.uk/).  Has this sort of
technology been considered by the Fonts group?  (or is it being, or
will it be?)

This is a genuine question, not meant to be sarcastic: what kind of
technology is it that the font designers wish to protect here?  Is it the
bezier data? The kerning and hinting information, that sort of thing?

Isn't this exactly the kind of thing that the font vendors wish to
prevent - high quality print reprodution?  This is one way in which
they could preserve their control on their fonts - license them to such
print-on-demand shops.
