Up to a point;  beyond the point it becomes an inconvenience.

Then mail the postmaster of the offending site;  many sites pull accounts
for that sort of thing.

Even now, the difference means that there is no way using one bitmap font
to display text identically on different window systems, unless you do some
(ugly) stretching of the font.

Would the people who use knockoff fonts purchase legitimate fonts if
knockoffs were unavailable?  I doubt it.  For legitimate fonts, one is
paying at least as much for quality and reliability as for the appearance
of the font.

Java applets for implementing fonts are an interesting idea, and better
than bitmaps.  Although I suspect that people would crack them soon 
enough (perhaps even for sport alone, as with games in the Amiga days).
(There is a recent technical report from IBM, showing how Java (because
of its portability and network security constraints) may be easily
decompiled.)  They'll help, to be sure, but like many door locks,
they're more a symbolic measure than a practical safeguard.  Education and
enforcement will do more to stop piracy.

I'm sorry to hear that.  Is that an actual copy of Trixie, or 
another typewriter font made in the same style (such as Harting)?

Understandably so.  But the need for scalable fonts for text and such 
won't go away either.  A fair deal may be easier to achieve by 
education and enforcement than by technology.  If we can persuade the
professional users of fonts that publishing with unlicensed fonts is 
too great a risk, that may eliminate many cases of font piracy.
(If one publishes with a pirated font, one may get caught; if one has a 
pirated font but does not publish with it, it is not of much use.)
That would also cause fewer technical problems.
