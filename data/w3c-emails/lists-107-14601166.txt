Uh huh. AGFA, Bitstream and Adobe surely know nothing about typefaces
and intellectual property rights. Guess again. Instead of blasting
outlines, why not wait for the W3C WebFonts draft and work with us to
address your underlying concerns? Attacking us is unlikely to solve
the intellectual property rights issue.

Lest there be any confusion concerning the [standard disclaimer]
part of my signature, I speak for myself here as a 12-year veteran
of the digital type biz, and not for my employer.
