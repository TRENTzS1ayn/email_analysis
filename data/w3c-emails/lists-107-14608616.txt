All of the above. Outline fonts provide incredible flexibility and 
versatile applications, They will function within for instance a webpage, 
but once released from its context, it can be used in many different 
ways. Writing letters, printing stuff etc. Sending along an outline font 
in a webpage will help to display the page in the way it was intended. 
But it can be used for other things at the receiving end. The reason 
outline fonts are preferred for onscreen type is also the reason why 
people will be interested to capture the type and use it for other 
purposes. This won't be allowed by enduser licenses of most 
typefoundries, but there is no way to police the piracy. Hence, a concern 
for typedesigners and typefoundries.

The printing of pixelfonts does not have to be a big problem. The font 
can contain orginal fontnames and ID's. People that own the fonts can use 
those in printing (substitution could even be automatic), others can use 
substitution fonts such as the schemes that acrobat uses, making a 
multiple master instance with the same width and weight. This scheme can 
also be used so overcome unaccaptable difference in rendered resolution 
of the font and the resolution of the screen.
