Well of course, but that point has not been reached in typeprotection. To 
continue a lame analogy: the doors are open and big neon signs on the 
roof saying "free fonts here"

On usenet? Nope.

It is always possible to construct a profile of someone who will or do 
won't do something. The number of people involved is so large that it is 
safe to assume that because these things _can_ happen they will happen on 
a large scale.

Java or something else. There are many other reasons to develop secure 
technologies. A javafont, or a font based on similar technology is 
already much more secure than an embedded type1 or truetype font. No 
technology will provide total safety, but current font technology offers 
none, whereas safer alternatives can be developed easily or are already 
present. Type deserves a better deal.

The original. 1991.

Daily practice for many typedesigners, foundries and distributors. 
Brochures, campaigns, ads, visits, publicity cases, clemency periods for 
pirates, stickers, articles, press. The type industry is doing everything 
it possibly can already to educate people about legalities and value of 
type.

The fact that piracy exist does not justify increasing it, or enabling it 
to increase.
