Yes.  Perhaps the X Font Server could at last come into its own.
It's not much good for anything else :-)  but the protocol does have
the vestages of micropayments in it.  They forgot kerning (although
Gallium have a font server that adds that) and they made a terrible
job of encodings in the sample implementation (don't know if Gallium
has fixed that; probably) but it is at least a possible base for
experimentation.

Of course, you'd also need a font server proxy... and its cache would
be an issue for micropayments.
