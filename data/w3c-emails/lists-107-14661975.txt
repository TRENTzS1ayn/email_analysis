As would the clients local cache. I remember reading in the Plan 9
documentation that 8 1/2 generally had a cache of < 2,500 glyph
images in it, so glyph server technology could be very useful
(ie. clients would soon build up a good working set). 

Another advantage to glyph servers (and idea I proposed more than a
year ago now) is that you could build up "virtual" fonts to handle
cases that occur often in scholarly texts (for example, the Buddhist
texts that are being put into SGML right now use a lot of uncommon
characters).
