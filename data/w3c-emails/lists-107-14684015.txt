     There are java classes for TrueDoc that are in the final stages called 
     Bitstro. They will be available of Mac and Unix soon. Are you aware of 
     any tools to compile C into Java?? We could use them. glen rippel

There are already 3 JAVA decompilers that I am aware of. All do a 
fairly reasonable job.
     
Using Java applets will not protect font information.
