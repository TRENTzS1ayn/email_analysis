The problem is, for the protection to be effective, the specification
has to be kept secret, otherwise there's nothing stopping someone from
hacking their browser to save them unencrypted.  And if the specification
is kept a secret, that discriminates against free software, by not allowing
free browsers (such as lynx and xmosaic) to have this functionality.
Until someone cracks it, of course.

And don't even mention US and other cryptography laws.
