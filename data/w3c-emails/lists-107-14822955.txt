This is a lie.

In the first place, the Acrobat default for font subsetting is 10% -- i.e.
if I include more than 10% of the characters in a given font in my PDF file,
Acrobat will automatically embed the entire font. In the second place, the
font _is_ installed in the user's system, that's how they are able to print
a PDF file. We can strip a fully functional font from a PDF file in a matter
of seconds. If the basic Acrobat encrypting methods are employed (any except
password encryption) it takes a few seconds longer.
