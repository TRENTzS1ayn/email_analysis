Yes, on certain platforms (i.e., Macintosh) an extracted font may be
transiently made available to the system. But, embedded fonts are never
permanently installed into the system by Acrobat... thus I stand by my
original statement.

So what? Any ten year old can copy any standard U.S. commercial software
install disk in a manner of seconds. Most likely they can copy your font
disks as well. A decade ago, commercial shrink-wrapped software was
universally copy protected in the U.S. - but it didn't stop hackers and it
did piss off legitimate customers.

You have the right to license your type any way you want, and Acrobat today
makes it clear that font embedding should be enabled only if your fonts are
licensed appropriately. Our authoring software respects the TrueType
embedding bits, which will be enhanced and extended in OpenType for both
TrueType and Type 1 technologies. And, different markets may require
different behavior (i.e., copy protection is still common in Japan, and so
we also support font outline encryption for Japanese fonts, which we hope to
strengthen in OpenType). So yes of course you should be able to "opt out" of
the system - legally and/or technically. I only argue that your moral high
ground is not sufficient justification for placing requirements on a
standards-based Web font solution that would either impair the solution or
delay its implementation. 

A couple of other minor points from your messages:
 
- font programs *can* be copyrighted in the U.S., something that Adobe and
Bitstream helped fight for.

- there is plenty of high-quality raster-based art on the Web. And, plenty
of vector graphics as well. In PDF files (though I guess you'll happily pick
on Acrobat for this also), VRML files, CAD files, etc. We need technical
protection for *all* intellectual property on the Web - it's just not going
to happen overnight.
