As paper has been the font transport mechanism in traditional publishing, 
TrueDoc is a font transport mechanism in electronic publishing. It provides 
the means for the legitimate owner/licensee of a font to publish documents 
electronically using that font. Nothing more. Nothing less.

TrueDoc faithfully reproduces font images at all resolutions. Indeed, 
TrueDoc format fonts are used in a number of laser printers. It is NOT a 
means for skirting copyright laws or for illegally copying fonts.

Actually TrueDoc addresses a number of your concerns:
  - TrueDoc files (PFRs) must be decoded to be used (preventing copying)
  - TrueDoc provides secure installation into the client environment
        so that only the installing application can use the font
  - TrueDoc is capable of transporting bitmap data

I hope this cuts through some of the confusion concerning TrueDoc. If I can 
be of any further assistance, please contact me.
