Bingo. Well put.

And by other groups. It is the community who do not currently use fonts now but
wish to in the future that is the growth area.

Why the restriction to "small" market groups? Just curious. Or was that an
ironic reference back to your "own corner" ;-)

OK, sounds interesting. You volunteering to put forward a discussion document?

Rather like certain Kanji fonts which are restricted to being imaged at low
resolution (below 600dpi) for example? Or a license for temporary installation
 for read only use with documents from a particular website?

There are likely to be several "fashions"; particular foundries might give
their assent in the license for some and not others. Machine-readable licenses
would be a help here.

Well, the existing options of including an explicit bar in the license, and of
prosecuting offenders, remain open. But I appreciate your concerns.

Sure. Nice point. Large corporates licensing particular faces on their
Websites to project the same image as their paper-based publications is
expected to be a growth area (and a market opportunity for typeface designers,
of course).
