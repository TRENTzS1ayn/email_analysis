It does *not*. Well maybe if you cannot tell the difference between Helvetica 
and Arial.

It seems to me that is entirely the result of attempting to skirt the (US) 
copyright laws rather than enabling reliable, solid encryption of original data.

It provides a simple method for extracting unprotected font outlines from 
distributed documents. Unprotected in terms of copyright, unprotected in terms 
of their ease of extraction from their carrier document.
