In many ways there is little difference between various forms of Intellectual 
Property, but fonts will *always* be different.

1Whereas many other media have protection from copying their forms
fonts do not. Anyone can copy a type design and call it their own.
The only things about fonts that are protected in US law is their
trade marked name, and the data in the case of a digitised font.

Note: the latter case is yet to be proven in a US court.

2Unlike photographs or illustrations fonts are tools in their own
right, they can be used to create new works.

3Almost without exception fonts exist today in a resolution independent
manner on the Net, this resolution independence can quickly be 
translated into platform or device independence.

4A font is the carrier of its own source code. All information needed to
re-engineer a font is contained within it.

Many large companies give free software out on the net, to promote 
other products in most cases, how many of them give out source code?

5For many type designers and small "foundries" fonts are their only
end product, there is nothing for them to cross-subsidise against.

Yes vector based fonts on the Net make sense, but I'd rather spend 18 months 
discussing it and getting it right than rushing out a solution that destroys the 
IPR of many small companies and individuals.

What opportunities will be lost by taking time to sort it out properly, only the 
leverage of larger companies that can afford to subsidise type output through 
other profit centres.
