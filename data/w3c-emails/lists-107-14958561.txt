Maybe something of what John (Tiro) meant was not picked up, or perhaps I'm just 
bringing my viewpoint to it, there is a fundamental difference between people 
who use type to view documents (currently everyone who can read) and those that 
use type to author documents.

From my perspective I'd like to see that differentiation maintained, fonts for 
viewing and fonts for authoring should be two different things, and the former 
should not be able to be converted into the latter. 

ie ink on paper cannot be changed into a digital font without a substantial time 
investment.

TruDoc goes some way towards this but IMO isn't *the* answer.
