That would be excellent if so. And ISO 10036 (font information exchange,
procedure for registration of font-related object identifiers ) which deals
with glyph identifiers, would be useful.

I have seen a working draft technical report from SC2 and SC18  "An operational
model for characters and glyphs" which is also relevant. I have seen hard copy
of (a DIS of) 10180 (standard page description language) which has some
interesting annexes making use of 9451.
