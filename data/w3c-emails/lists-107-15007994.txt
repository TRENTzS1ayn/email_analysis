I think it's fair to say that the success of PostScript is due not only 
to Adobe's unmatched commitment to product development, but to their 
savvy recognition of the fact that any vehicle which promotes the 
encouragement of this platform is in the company's best interest. Adobe's 
studied decision to discontinue the locked downloader in 1988 encouraged 
the dissemination of PostScript fonts, and helped to establish PostScript 
as a de facto industry standard. Does the epidemic of font piracy do any 
different?
