If one's purpose is to steal a font from an Acrobat file,it hardly matters
whether the necessary data is 'transiently made available' or permanently
installed. The point is, it's there, it's easy to find and easy to strip.

This is the most arse-backwards argument I've come across (and unfortunately
I hear it all the time):

'It is easy to steal fonts by copying disks, so people are doing it;
therefore, let's give them another, even easier way to steal fonts, and make
this one really special by allowing the pirates to send the fonts to
millions of anonymous people all over the globe via the glories of the World
Wide Web!'

Perhaps Tom Rickner is right: if this is Adobe's attitude, they should just
start embedding PageMaker and Illustrator in electronic documents and
sending them off into the great wide world to try their luck.

That's really big of you. We can tell people that they're not allowed to
embed our fonts, but we're not actually allowed to do anything to prevent
them. It is illegal to steal cars, but I'm sure you don't rely on the fact
to protect your vehicle if you leave the doors unlocked and the key in the
ignition. If you agree that we have the right to protect our fonts by any
licencing agreement we choose to draft, why won't you acknowledge that we
have the right to demand a technical implementation of that protection? At
no point in any of this discussion have I said that embedding is
intrinsically wrong -- what I have said is that the implementation of
embedding should be tailored to the legal protection of that which is
embedded. Since, as you yourself point out, the principal legal protection
for a piece of software is specified in its licencing agreement, the content
and nature of which is determined -- by right -- by the software
manufacturer, doesn't it also make sense that the level of technical
protection should also be determined by said manufacturer (in this instance
the humble type designer).

The legal option is, de facto, meaningless without the technical option. I'm
glad to hear that protection is probably going to be strengthened in
OpenType, and look forward to learning the details.

We're probably never going to agree on that. It's in your interests to push
something out before someone else does (and, frankly I'd rather see Adobe
tackling this than most other software companies), regardless of IP and
technical protection issues. It is not in our interests to have anything
released until the latter concerns have been properly addressed. Given the
way money has of moving mountains (and moral high ground with them), you
will probably win... Somewhere, I believe, there is a balance which we'll
both have to compromise with: How fast is fast enough for you? How secure is
secure enough for us?
