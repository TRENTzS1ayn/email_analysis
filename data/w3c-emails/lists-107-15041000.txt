The problem with machine-readable licenses is that they're only as
reliable as whatever reads them.  Were software development restricted
to a guild of licensed artisans, conforming to a strict code of ethics,
they may be workable.  But, as anyone with a C compiler can write or
modify a browser, they're no more an option against piracy than banning 
unescrowed encryption is against terrorism.

That's a somewhat disturbing undercurrent in the "IP protection" 
concept.  To work, to be airtight, IP protection would have to build 
a closed system of applications whose formats and specifications were
kept secret, to the exclusion of free software.  Whether or not that is 
any more workable than Type 1 encryption was, it would freeze out 
free software and truly open, documented standards in favour of a
technical oligarchy.
