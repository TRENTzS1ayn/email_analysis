Well why didn't you say so before, or better yet explain precisely how this
works and how independent type foundries will go about implementing it --
then we'll let you know what our 'problem' is, if any remain. By 'your'
embedding DLL, I presume you are referring to OpenType. If so, I'm very glad
to hear it, as David Lemon long since succeeded in convincing me of the
basic virtues of the OT format and I hoped it might also provide better
protection than other embedding schemes. Taking into account that a great
many type designers are not necessarily programmers, perhaps you could
explain to us, in simple terms, how this is going to work. If it provides
the kind of security we're looking for, OT can expect our full support and
encouragement.
