- One problem might be that is very easy to change the OS/2 table bits.
- Another problem might be that font foundries may have felt
that it was a good idea to allow embededding into Word documents
and the like, which are exchanged on a one to one basis. But
time has moved on and now the prospects are that documents are
exchanged at a one to a million basis. Similar situation with Type 1 and
Acrobat, where foundries agreed to embedding in a quite different
market (apart from the fact that the best fonts of these foundries
had already been absorbed into the Adobe library. Not much point
to say "no, thank you", was there?)
- Another problem might be that there may be other DLL's, and
we know that having the licence bit sets does not guaranty anything.

It may be a good idea for Adobe and Microsoft make public what safety
they actually propose for OpenType. And more important what safety
there is for the existing stock of TT and more important T1. No licence
bits in Type 1 are there?
