Does your DLL work with Acrobat? How easy is it to override? How easy is it to 
get a usable font from a document? Does it work with all currently available 
font formats? Is the embedded data a complete and usable font, unrestricted in 
any way? Does the tooth fairy leave fonts under your pillow?

Those are just a few of the problems, do you have all the answers?

You may cite legal protection to these problems at the end of the day, I don't 
want legal solutions, I want technological prevention.
