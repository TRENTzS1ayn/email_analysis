I wrote, via e-mail to Bill McCoy (who had outlined the ways in which one
could search for stolen fonts on the Web) :

To which Bill responded that he didn't see how this was any different from
clip-art images, and failed to understand the substantive difference between
the cases (despite Clive's eloquent explications).

The difference between fonts and clip-art is that (presuming a font actually
contains letterforms and not just dingbats) fonts are a collection of images
of commonly recognised forms (letters) which may be combined to produce
other commonly recognised forms (words) which can be combined to communicate
ideas, concepts, etc.. Clip-art is a form of low-end filler for people who
can't afford to hire professional illustrators or photographers. I suppose
there are some people who design type for a clip-art market and are happy to
view their work in this way. I design type for a graphic design, typography
and publishing market. It is actually not in my interests, nor in the
interests of my intended customers, to have every Tom, Dick and Harriet
flinging my fonts all over the world via the Internet. 

Besides which, saying 'The way people steal fonts is just like the way they
steal clip-art' is hardly addressing the main point, which is that people
will steal anything if you make it easy for them, and an insecure webfont
format makes it bloody easy to steal fonts.

By the way, Bill, I hope you don't mind if I take this discussion back to
the group now. I think you and I have a slightly better grasp of where each
other is coming from, and I'll try not to be so bolshy :-)
