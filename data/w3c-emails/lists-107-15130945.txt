I didn't reply to the list...)

Such a restriction would be technically enforcible;  this could be done
by flattening the curves in the font to straight lines, with the tolerance
set appropriately for the intended resolution.  Thus, a font could be released
in various "grades";  a cheaper low-grade version which would scale and 
render well at low resolutions (i.e., in browsers) but which would not look 
good when printed on a high-resolution device, and a more expensive 
print-grade version with the curves intact.

This could be supplemented with other tweaks (i.e., removing flex
information in favour of pre-rendering curves for low resolutions)
which would make a low-resolution version of the font.
