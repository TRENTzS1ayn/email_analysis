Ah, but thhis IS Adobe's attitude- they've told everyone who owns a copy 
of distiller that's its perfectly legal to embed Adobe et al fonts, ie 
give them away

Adobe has a responsibility to build in some better embedding protection. 
It's currently laughable, and currently attempts are being made to work 
around it.  Not that they have the interest of course. Wha't's a few 
fonts to them?

I expect PM abs PS to be a matter of time  ;-)
