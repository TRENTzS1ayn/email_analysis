Following up on the whole digraphs & trigraphs method, there's also the 
font which contains seemingly randomized metrics, with a handful of 
"metrics only" characters serving to properly letterspace them. Think of 
it as the "measure four liters using a five liter jug and a three liter 
jug" school of typography: no two characters will function properly in 
context unless the text stream contains the correct combination of 
characters and fractional spaces.

(If this is opaque, let me know.)
