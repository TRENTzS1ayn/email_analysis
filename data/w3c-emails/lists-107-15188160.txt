Would it be possible to print a hex dump of a font file, and copyright
that particular sequence as intellectual property?  I have seen
copyrighted books about the number pi.  It seems like pi would be
more public domain than a font would be.

Of course, if I took my favorite hex editor and changed a name like
"Adobe" to "Brick", the sequence would be slightly different.

Just a curious non-lawyer--and I say that proudly :-)
