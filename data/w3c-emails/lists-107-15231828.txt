Nothing. I came to that conclusion a *long* time ago, for the reasons
Glen gives, and others (downloading 2MB of Japanese font is not so
much fun). that is why I proposed the "glyph server" idea about 18
months or so ago. It gives people security, a method for
micro-payments if necessary, and also allows negotiation of formats,
among other things.

Now if I only had time to actually write up my design, or better, to 
write the code... as it is now, I'll probably get to it late this
year.
