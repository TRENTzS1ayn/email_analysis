I can't believe that Bill Gates is hell bent on liberating everybody's
fonts by ignoring or side-stepping the private font installation
facilities in Windows. Even if the browser *is* the OS, the user agent
for viewing HTML Web pages should still respect the font protection
mechanisms either proposed or finally agreed upon and implemented.

Well, I agree that we should not give end-users the impression that
fonts are free (except if they are specifically identified as such). But
we are not talking about end-users distributing the fonts. I am
suggesting that Web page authors and publishers who have purchased or
licensed a legitimate copy of a font should be able to publish with it,
without worrying that it will "accidently" fall into the hands of users
who did not pay for the privilege of publishing with that font, and that
we in the industry have an obligation to find a method that lets
publishers use the fonts they own without that risk.

I *do not* speak for Bitstream, but I honestly don't think that either
Adobe nor Bitstream, nor Microsoft want to give away all their fonts.
Nor do they want to force you to give away yours. You are free to write
your license agreements to prohibit electronic publication and
distribution, if you want. None of the major type foundries will look on
you as some sort of pariah if you retain that sort of control over your
work.

Are you saying that you would make a reference to Adobe's server, even
if you did not own a licensed copy of Minion, and if they were feeling
magnanmous at the time your Web page was read, and served up a free
copy, you'd be happy. And if not, no big deal? Or are you saying that
*if* you owned a licensed copy of Minion and it could be served from
Adobe's server you would make the reference point to Adobe's site?

What if you owned a licensed copy of Minion and the license allowed you
to publish any document using it over the Web. If you reference Adobe's
server for Minion and they happen to be down that day, or have changed
their mind about free distribution, wouldn't you feel cheated? Would you
sue for breach of contract? Wouldn't it be better to serve *your* copy
of Minion from *your* server?

My proposal includes provision for font substitions. If you are
publishing using a font with restrictions, you _should_ use the matching
or synthesis references. I, for one, am not advocating that publishers
ignore the licensing restrictions on the fonts they own.

If you re-read the proposal I think you will see that I am not
advocating the distribution of fonts. I am looking for a way to let
publishers publish typographically rewarding documents on the Web with
the fonts they own, and presumably have a right to use.

Again, I don't think Bitstream wants to just give away its fonts, nor is
it asking you to do so.
