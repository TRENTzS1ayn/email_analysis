Why?  Anyone can write a browser.  The server either provides a copy
of a font or it doesn't.  Protection after that can always be gotten
around, unfortunately.

There's a difference between use and distribute.  Publishers have the
right to use the fonts they bought.  They don't have a right to distribute
them.  I'd like to find a method which will allow publishers to use fonts
on the web without distributing them, because that's all they have the
right to do.  TrueDoc and such are methods for distributing the fonts
as well as using them.

Microsoft is giving away all the fonts it has the rights to.  All the
ones included with Office and with Windows, and all the ones it's
commissioned for the web.

Adobe and Bitstream have put forth technologies which allow anyone with
a copy of their fonts to redistribute it.  That's what TrueDoc and it's
kind do.  If they don't want to give away their fonts, they screwed up.

So you add a method for listing the document server as well, and in
purchasing a font you register your document server.  Then Adobe can
provide the font only if the document server is listed as owning the
font.  (Good luck arguing that AOL cannot legally allow any of their
users to publish using Minion by purchasing just one copy in that case.
The licenses would be a nightmare to work out, but probably could be.)

It would be better to serve my copy from my server, if I had the right
to do that.  But I don't.  It's not that hard to set up a distributed
network of font servers which will pretty well ensure access even if
one server goes down.

Unfortunately, your proposal includes distributing the fonts.  Yes, you
want to protect them.  Yes, if everybody plays along, the fonts will
remain secure.  But I don't want to gamble on that.  If everybody played
fair, we wouldn't have pirated software and bootleg CDs.

Everybody wants designers to be able to use fonts in their web pages.
The question is how to make that feasible, and how to keep it legal.
TrueDoc makes it feasible, but arguably not legal.  I like the basis
of your proposal.  Don't distribute the fonts openly, and don't
distribute them as a direct part of the web page.  However, unless
the web author has the right to distribute them at all, why not just
change the proposal slightly so that it's the proper person distributing
the fonts?  I think we agree on almost everything here.  It's just
a question of who actually sends out the font.

Any proposal which includes having individuals who purchased copies
of fonts redistribute those fonts is not likely to be legal, no matter
how noble the goals.  I exchanged plenty of e-mail months ago with
folks at Bitstream about TrueDoc, where I pointed out the legal problems,
and Bitstream kept responding that their intentions were noble.  I don't
care about Bitstream's intentions.  I care about my bottom line on the
fonts I sell, and I'll protect my rights to the fonts I create.

Yours,
