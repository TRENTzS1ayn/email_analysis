The browser will resolve these automatically -- that's no help from the
security point of view.  However, I do suggest that in *addition* to
other form of encryption, the server name used to fetch the font be used as
part of the encryption key.  In that way, if someone copies a font, they
won't be able to use it.  If the URL was forced to be relative, or (better)
in the same 2nd level domain as the referring document (the same algorithm
that Netscape uses for cookies woul dbe appropriate), you would not be able
to point your style sheet at a font that someone else had paid for.

I agree with this.  By itself, it is easily circumvented, but in conjunction
with the simple additional encryption I suggested, this would prevent
`casual piracy'.

Again, if the font is encrypted in a way that involves its URL, as well
as the OpenType wrapper's encryption, the browser can simply store the
(insecure) byte stream it fetched over the network.

Well, then people in a corporate environment using a firewall probably can't
see the font at all.  Worse, SSL isn't in all browsers, and there are
problems with exporting SSL-aware code from the USA.  However, you could
simply use an SSL URL to do this; no attribute is needed.

So all of Adobe's fonts are accessible for free over the web, for screen
and print use???  No, that won't work.
Also, like server-side rendering, this has a severe performance penalty --
even at only a couple of million hits a day, Adobe's twenty new high-end
SPARCserver systems (that they don't have right now) would be on their knees,
as would the Californian internet backbone.  And every web access in Europe
or Down Under would fetch 20K or 100K from California... which would be a
bandwidth disaster.  Of course, if the fonts were available from the vendor's
sites for free, as your suggestion implies (or with a registration number
that I can copy), people could make ftp mirrors all round the world, and
font picracy would cease to be an issue :-)

I haven't heard them make any such statement.  In order to use their
TrueDoc system, you have to have a copy of the font in the first place;
whether the resulting TruDoc font is of high enough quality, and whether it
can be extracted from the transmitted document, those are different questions.
As far as I can tell, TrueDoc does not encourage giving fonts away any
more than Acrobat :-) -- if anything, considerably less.

This (I think) is a common error.  If the price becomes 1/10th of today's
prices, but you sell 1,000 times more, you will be very happy.
