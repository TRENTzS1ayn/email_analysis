I think that is entirely reasonable, as long as those publishers have paid for 
extra licensing, the fonts are tagged as belonging to them and they cannot be 
extracted from the carrier doc and reused elsewhere.

But designers and foundries need not only the chance to opt-out of such a 
scheme, they need to be reassured that they won't be opted-in by force, ie by 
some hacker.

Some form of "font-fauxing" as Adobe's Acrobat supplies would also not go amiss.
