This is a good point. I was thinking mainly of discouraging curious
end-users from just swiping the full URL and embedding it in their own
local Web page or trying something as mundane as just FTPing directly
from the originial server. In addition, URLs of the form
"~fonts/xxx.ttf" might be resolved at the server side if ~fonts is
aliased.

Also a very good suggestion. With the local copy of the font encrypted
with the server name, the font becomes tied to a specific site. Even if,
thwarting all the other security we might choose to throw at it, an
end-user managed to extract the font, he still can use it.

Exactly my point.

Actually, I think this has a positive for people in a corporate site
behind the firewall. The company will probably want to do internal
publishing, using site licensed fonts (possibly custom designed) which
they don't want to get loose. The people behind the firewall could get
the fonts from the document server behind the wall, people outside
can't. It works both ways.

If you are using a browser without SSL, you simply wouldn't see the
secure font. No worse than if the browser didn't implement the font
reference mechanism.

My idea was, that if you really wanted to secure the *transmission*
(i.e. protect it from packet sniffers, etc.) of the font (or any other
data, for that matter) you would take the pains to put your documents on
a secure server. The attribute was merely to inform the browser that it
had better be prepared to talk to a secure server.
