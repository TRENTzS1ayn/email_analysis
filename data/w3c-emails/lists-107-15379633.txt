Why shouldn't bitmap fonts be fast enough? With a little bit of ingenuity,
you can cache fonts in regularly requested sizes at the server (in the way
TeX/Metafont do it, namely that a font at a given resolution is calculated
when needed, but then not thrown away), at the client site, and maybe
on the way between them (e.g. Newzealand uses a countrywide cache).
For most sizes, you don't have to differentiate between 72dpi and 75dpi.
