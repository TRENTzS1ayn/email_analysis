Almost every company does this. There's an invisible line beneath which 
the corporate style book is irrelevant; internal communication, from 
correspondence to the company newsletter, is largely driven by what's 
available. Awful lot of Arial being used instead of McGraw Hill Roman, 
Raytheon Sans, and so on.

Whether this affects the discussion, I don't know; it seemed to me that 
the firewall issue had more to do with those who access the web from 
restricted environments; will this mean, for them, no reading? Perhaps 
once The Great Font Server is established, some sort of SuperATMesque 
font substitution system will be in order?
