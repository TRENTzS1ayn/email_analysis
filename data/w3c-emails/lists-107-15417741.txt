It does, but in a negligible way. The original poster argued that
companies would like to use certain custom-designed fonts
inhouse only, which would be ensured by firewalls. I wanted to say
that a company would use the same custom-designed fonts inhouse
and for outside communication. Now you say that in most cases,
there is a difference, but the custom-designed fonts are used
for outside communication, and the generic ones inhouse.
This rather clearly makes firewalls useless for the protection of
custom-designed fonts.

Regrads,Martin.
