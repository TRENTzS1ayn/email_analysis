Yes, it's clear that if there is a small, fixed-sized market, there is a
limit to the increase in sales you get for reducing the price.
But that is not true in all cases.

Fonts on the Web could lead to vastly greater exposure for small
font foundries, who may well experience significantly increased revenue.
It remains to be seen.

Consider the possibility of a `purchase this font' button in Netscape or
Microsoft Interenet Explorer -- it looks in the font for the URL of the
vendor & the foundry, and offers to connect you...  This is of course
technically possible, if OpenType includes the necessary information.

For that matter, when you save the document and open it in Page Mill or
HoTMetaL Pro, maybe you could get a similar `purchase opportunity' :-)
