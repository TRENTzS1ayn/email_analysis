Okay, so maybe SSL is not the answer. We need just *some* standard
encryption
mechanism that both browser and server can agree on to transmit the
font.

I'm sure they'd love it. (:-)

If it's encrypted, what good does it do you to steal it from the site.
Fonts on document servers probably *should* be encrypted. But then we
are talking about a standard encryption. If this is spec'd, what's to
keep someone from writing a browser or "font-crawler" specifically for
collecting fonts - they'd know how to decrypt any font they request.
Perhaps the idea of a "trusted agent" comes into play here. A document
or font server has to have a trusted authentication exchange with the
client before it serves up a font?

Or encrypted by the browser if it was not sent securely, or just
encrypted by the browser (say with its own public key) anyway.

Yes. This is a problem with PS print files. The browser could certainly
build its own reencoding vector, but I think this is probably a lot to
ask of the browser writers. They would probably be happier if they could
just use the standard OS print mechanics.

Both Windows and Mac OSes have these mechanisms available. This is how
MS Word does embedding now (not that I am recommending *embedding* for
Web fonts!). I have written a few apps that use private installation.
It's relatively easy (tho obscure) and the fonts _do not show up_ in
other apps menus (or in Windows' font folder, for that matter).

I agree. This is why I suggested that only relative URLs be used in the
markup, and the browser would enforce the "no other server" protocol for
font references. Netscape already does this for Java applets.

Possibly a good item to add to the "document info" menu item (I know,
not all browsers implement it - they really should).
