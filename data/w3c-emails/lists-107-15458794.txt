This will *never* happen, any site that is distributing stolen fonts openly on 
the net will be closed down.

Would they have gotten rich on one tenth of their income, it is generally 
excepted that font piracy runs at much higher rates than other software.

Can you justify this statement with some facts, if the fonts are not available 
for downloading how will that scenario prevail, it doesn't at the moment. Where 
a pdf is distributed without embedded fonts people don't go out searching for 
those missing fonts, they make do with interpolation.

Perhaps you should consider making a distinction between authors and users, 
authors require fonts to work with and create documents, users only require to 
see the finished documents.

A weird contradiction here "users won't tolerate bitmaps", have a look at the 
graphics on the web, 99.9% bitmaps, the only viable, widespread solution to 
this is Acrobat, but how often do you see PDF embedded in HTML?

>they won't tolerate font substitution
>(or so the experience with pdf suggests).

Ok, it's very easy to put that one to bed, you seem to be inferring that use of 
Acrobat has increased many fold since the introduction of v2.0 and font 
embedding, unfortunately you're taking the facts and moulding them to your 
theory. Here's the facts:

Font embedding has been available in Acrobat since version 1.0, take a 
look at the pdfmark 1.0 spec.

Acrobat 1.0 didn't achieve widespread aclaim since, IMO, it was 
mis-marketed by Adobe, a very powerful tool was sold to the wrong
customers and shunned by the right ones.

Reader v1.0 cost around $40, which lead to the slow take-up of end-users,
this was corrected in v2.0 when the Reader became free, a powerful
incentive.

The Internet market has grown substantially since v1.0, and so has its 
requirements for document fidelity, therefore it is not surprising that
recent versions of Acrobat have better penetration in this market.

I think all of the above disprove your theory, if I understand it correctly - 
if not please feel free to correct.
