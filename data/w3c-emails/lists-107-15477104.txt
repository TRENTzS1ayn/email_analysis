Why not? What is to stop designers loading a copyrighted Type 1 font
into Fontographer, stripping out all the copyright information, altering
the outlines slightly (they'll still look the same on screen), hacking
out those unwanted accented characters and then saving it out as a
TrueType font for distribution from a site in the way I've described?
People get away with doing this now, and even have the cheek to sell the
results on CD Rom. They are not going to stop doing so on the Web for
fear of prosecution. The only way to stop this from happening is to give
designers an alternative - and I can't see any other  alternative except
for secure, legal embedding of fonts specifically licensed for this
purpose.
