""PAY 5 DOLLARS AND SEE THIS AD THE WAY IT WAS INTENDED!""

Who would pay money to buy the Kodak font, or the CocaCola font? 
Advertising and corporate identity are two good reasons to develop better 
typographic tools for the web, but it is in the advertisers' and 
publishers' advantage to use particular fonts. The person viewing the 
webpage is largely indifferent. A company with a web presence might not 
even want to sell a font to a user. They just want to be able to let the 
font be used on the viewers' screen, not donate or sell it to him.

Buying fonts this way might be an interesting way to sell fonts to 
individual computer jockeys, it is not really a method to solve the 
various problems of fonts on the web.

Though this is somewhat tangential to the fontsecurity discussion, and 
does not invalidate Lee's other arguments.
