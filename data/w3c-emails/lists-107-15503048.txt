What if it's at 14-point on a 180-dpi display with anti-aliasing, for an effective resolution superior to that of some print? Such displays are not so far off, even very cheaply with high-contrast cholesteric liquid crystal displays now in labs. 

The tortuous hinting requirements imposed by low-res 1-bit displays are a passing problem. Between ATM 4 and Win95's services, I'm confident that a year from now system-level anti-aliasing will be commonplace for all who appreciate it (and increasingly for those who don't know the difference). Even at 72 dpi, good anti-aliasing makes for appreciable differences between the letterforms of, say, Simoncini and Stempel Garamond at text sizes. 

I daresay that among those who care about type today, a great many have developed their sensibilities more through the CRT than the printed page. I can still remember realizing with some surprise (and sadness) that Hermann Zapf would probably not even recognize Palatino from Adobe's 12-point bitmap. (I'm sure he'd have no trouble spotting an immaculately anti-aliased knockoff version, however.) 

I think the larger issue is where an artist's performance ends and a subject's reception begins. There's no insurmountable impediment for a sensitive subject, and - do what you will - no sure help for an insensitive one, not even 4800 dpi. If you were a musician, would you refuse to let your performances be recorded for fear that somebody might listen with a cheap radio? Wouldn't that make you more calligrapher than type designer?
