I like the idea of micropayments -- it will be a good thing when it arrives.

I was thinking the same thing -- a "font usage" list in View Document Info
would be great. And taking that idea to the next level:

Log References to Fonts

I would like to see browsers keep a history file something like this:

    URL  font1 font2 font3
or
    URL  1: font1 font2 font3  2: font4 font5  3: font6 font7

where 1, 2, and 3 indicate stylesheet priority (non-stylesheet browsers
would either have only "1" or no priority indicator field).

Users could periodically review their "font-reference-history" list and
decide on font purchases, and/or if fontserving is available instruct
their browser to purchase or rent specific fonts. (rent = micropayment)

Font substitution/fauxing, while not an ultimate solution in itself, still
serves its purpose of "tiding people over" until they purchase the real
font. It has its place still.

BTW, how can a font be embedded in a platform-independent way? I think
embedding is unnecessary overhead. Let the acquisition of fonts be a
_browser_ issue, _not_ a document issue.
