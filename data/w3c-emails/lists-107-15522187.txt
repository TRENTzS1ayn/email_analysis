TrueDoc is a technology that allows scaleable outlines to be rendered on a 
remote viewing system. It is designed to facilitate the use of fonts, not their 
distribution. 

TrueDoc font files cannot be installed directly into operating systems, and are 
of no use to non-TrueDoc programs. The viewing system must have a TrueDoc 
enabled user agent in order to display the outlines. TrueDoc's native font 
interfaces (a) build temporary fonts (in memory) in the client system's native 
format and (b) install them as PRIVATE fonts, unavailable to other apps or to 
the user via a font selection dialog.

TrueDoc is licensed to legitimate developers for specific implementations. While
the technology certainly *could* be manipulated to illegally copy fonts, any 
developer that did so would clearly be prosecutable. And you better believe that
anyone using TrueDoc without a license (the most likely case for any 'font 
crawler' type use) will be hearing from Bitstream's legal department.....

NO. On two counts.

1) TrueDoc works with all font formats from all foundries - not just 
Bitstream fonts.

2) As discussed above, TrueDoc is for facilitating the use of fonts, 
not the illegal distribution of them.

As long as copying fonts is made difficult enough, only someone trying to 
bootleg fonts for money will bother with it, and we have a successful 
history of prosecuting these cases.
