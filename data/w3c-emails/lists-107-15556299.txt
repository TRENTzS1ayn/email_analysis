Kodak, and CocaCola respectively.

Having the viewer pay is one model. Having the corporation who are trying to
promote a corporate identity pay is another, complementary model. This is
easier, since they are accustomed to paying for this anyway in their print
publications.

Once HTML pages can contain references to fonts, large websites will be hiring
type designers just like they hire graphic designers now, to give their siteas
a particular look that stands out from the crowd.

Right, exactly. As you say, the corporate customers want the viewer to see the
right font on screen. Although the particular case of the "CocaCola" script
font (or worse, the K in Kodak) are probably not good examples, since these are
logos and would be better transferred as inline vector graphics (converted to
curves) rather than as text plus a font reference.
