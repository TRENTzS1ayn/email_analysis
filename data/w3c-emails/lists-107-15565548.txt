One can certainly hope so, and this may well be a market that many type
designers will try to break into. From the corporate perspective, though,
security is at least a big a concern as it is for independent type
designers. If a large corporation is to invest a good deal of money in a
unique typeface in order to make their website look spiffy, the last thing
they want is for everyone who logs in to the website to be able to steal
that investment.
