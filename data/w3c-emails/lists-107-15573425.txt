TrueDoc performs the same function as a FAX machine. The difference is 
that TrueDoc rasterizes at the receiver instead of the sender, allowing 
the use of the best possible resolution.

Not the same. The legal use of a novel is for reading (or as a paper 
weight, window prop, or door stop, I suppose :-) ). The legal use of 
a font is to publish a document. Publishing inherently entails 
imaging the font. TrueDoc only delays the time at which the final 
imaging is done.

A challenge without knowing what the data format is....

Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.

Bitstream says it's OK to distribute the TrueDoc font resource ONLY in 
conjunction with an associated document to be imaged on the client 
system.

Our licensees receive the right to distribute programs capable of 
creating and/or rendering TrueDoc Portable Font Resources. They are 
allowed to distribute TrueDoc font resources only if they have 
licensed the font(s) for redistribution.

The font files may only be used to render the document they are 
associated with.

See previous response.

Michael, I'm glad that you're taking the time to explain your concerns. With 
this detailed explanation, I can see that part of the problem is a lack of clear
understanding of what TrueDoc is and what it does. (Which in turn is likely due 
to poor communications on our part.)

I hope I've been able to answer your (and everyone else's) concerns. If not, 
I'll be happy to keep going on both the public and private channels.

I think you'll find that Bitstream's aims and concerns are congruent with those 
of font designers. After all, what value is there to a remote font imaging 
technology (i.e. TrueDoc) if everyone already has the fonts????

Thanks for your input!
