So the world's large corporations are going to take on the role of looking after 
the world's type designers, I think not.

Very rarely do they actually pay for new type design, why should they start 
doing that now?

Like large websites hire graphic designers now? Joke right?

The one example of this that I have seen, outside of MS, is at least a stolen 
design if not worse.

I think someone who should know has already discounted this theory, Bill Hill of 
Microsoft recently said here that he thought it unlikely that this kind of model 
could sustain the range and diversity of type design today.

Why should we doubt the words of someone that has actually been through that 
process and come out the other side?
