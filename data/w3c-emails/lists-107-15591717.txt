If you are alledging that major corporations never or rarely purchase their
fonts, I hope you have some documentary proof. How then do the font foundries
stay in business?

Sure they hire designers now. If you are unaware of this, I can only conclude
that you have incredibly limited experience of corporate website development.
Actually, the money that some companies are willing to sink into graphics
design for websites sometimes amazes me. [Until I see what they sink into print
and TV advertising, when I realise this is small potatoes indeed].

He was talking about a different type of model. Read what _he_ wrote! He was
talking about a mmodel where a site commissions a font which is then given
away, in fully installable form, for anyone to use on any website or in any
software product or ... this is somewhat different from a corporation using
their corporate image fonts on their own website, such that they are only
usable on that website.

I have no reason to doubt his words, nor do I. Then again, I have read them ;-)
