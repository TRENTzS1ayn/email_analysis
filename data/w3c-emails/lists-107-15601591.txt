As far as I remember it a fax has a fixed resolution, TruDoc has no such 
limitation, it embeds vector based fonts in documents, this has no resemblence 
to a fax whatsoever.

This is obviously the sort of misinformation that the TrueDoc consortium is 
distributing to its employees, as I've heard exactly the same line on a number 
of occasions.

Yes, took me all of half an hour. I wish everything else in lfe were so 
"challenging".

But can do nothing to stop those being separated.

So what is the difference between it and PDF embedding then?

Isn't this what it is and what it does:

Creates a poor quailty trace of an original font, thereby removing all
"software" copyright.

Makes that "resource" (I note with interest, as I'm sure others have, that 
you have begun to call these things "fonts") available to anyone with half
an ounce of spare grey matter, circumventing all copyright and licensing
agreements.

Therefore creating the instant TrueDoc font cloning factory.

Don't understand that, "if everyone already has the fonts", of course they don't 
already have the fonts, but you can sure provide them with facsimiles, ah, at 
last, the fabled fax link!
