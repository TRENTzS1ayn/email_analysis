Read what *I* wrote before replying. I said that they rarely pay for new type 
design, not that they didn't license type which isn't the same thing.

My own experience from dealing with large companies is that they will licence  
*some* of their fonts, not all. Mumping is endemic.

That is my point, the money generated from print and TV does not compare to web 
graphics, they may pay a consultant for an overview, but designers aren't in 
there at every stage as with other media.

"Which are only usable on their website", and which embedding model in current 
use does that?

And I wouldn't be able to quote them if I hadn't, the model is clear, the Font 
Face tag is the thin end of the wedge, people are already giving away cloned 
fonts on their sites. There is currently no alternative model (aside from 
Acrobat).

Why bother with embedding when fonts are free anyway?
