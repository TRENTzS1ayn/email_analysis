I agree. It was that premise that started this thread on protecting fonts. 
Something I think we should get back to.

Whether fonts are distributed as outlines or bitmaps, unless protected they 
are still subject to theft. It's no more difficult to write a font crawler 
that collects a full set of pixel fonts in various sizes than it is to 
write one to collect outlines.

The W3C font work group has been working very hard to design a mechanism 
that is easily extensible to handle the wide variety of font mechanisms - 
those existing and those yet to be created. I think we've been successful, 
but you'll get an opportunity to judge for yourself in the near future.

The current font draft will allow LettError to create a pixel font engine 
for use with their fonts. It will plug right in, invisible to the end 
user. Go for it.
