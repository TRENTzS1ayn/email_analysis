Don't kid yourself. Anything you want floats around. Check 
alt.binaries.mac.games (or games.mac I forget) Most major application are 
available. There are similar groups for software for other platforms. 
Online distribution of software is something different as embedding of 
fonts in webdocuments, different goals, different methods. Furthermore, 
software is usually much more complex than a typeface: online distributed 
software can protect itself in a number of ways., demos with limited 
functionality could be given away to promote the full version of an app. 
This approach does not work type. 
It does not matter if it is only one user offering software or a font, 
powerful search engines will find it, and all webusers will have access 
to it. Such is the nature of the beast.

Because the bigger companies have something to balance equal out the 
possible loss they make. Adobe hopes to sell more postscripts licenses, 
Microsoft hopes for more windows, Bitstream hopes to license trudoc. Many 
foundries don't have anything to gamble with except for their libraries. 
There just aren't that many typecompanies in the world to create your 
great hew, except for the ones that have been actively participating in 
this group. Though the  number of typecompanies is small, it's all there 
is, and making it difficult for these companies to make a living by 
making type is not a good idea in the 'information age'

A public key/private key encryption system only protects against 
eavesdroppers, not against abuse when the font is decrypted and ready for 
rasterisation.

I wish it were propaganda. Unfortunately I have direct experience with 
the number of copies sold, and the number of actual users of my type. 
Neither gives me much reason to be optimistic about human nature or civic 
duties when font piracy comes to the web.

That's because the topology of disseminating fonts in MS-Word documents 
(one to few) is different from webpages (one to many). Even if I were to 
give my fonts away to everyone I know, and encourage them to do the same, 
only a selected number of people will have access to them in a certan 
period. Publishing one document on the web will provide efficient instant 
parallel access to many people. It will much easier to get a font from a 
webpage than to ask your friends.

All it needs one small app posted on a webpage to make it available to 
all. It Bitstream going to police it? is microsoft?

I'm pessimistic because there are not many reasons to be optimistic. Font 
piracy has reached an impressive level without the help of speedy 
networks, powerful search engines and anonymous remailers. Introducing 
fonts on the web seems to only increase the exposure fonts have, and only 
increase the amount of illegal use. I don't assume users are willing to 
buy my fonts when they received them for free from some page the day 
before. I'm sure everybody is trying hard to make something that works, 
but as a small typemanufacturer I rely completely on what gets approved 
by microsoft and adobe. Even a good secure system of webfonts will 
increase exposure compared to not doing it at all. Don't get me wrong, 
I'm convinced that webfonts are necessary, but because of the number of 
users involved a small difference in security means a massive difference 
in exposure, and it is worthwile to make sure to get the possible 
possible solution.
I can try to smile when I say "it has to be better than that"

Not *every* programmer, no. But some of them will, and some of them will 
provide these hacks to the general public in the same manner as the fonts 
will be available. 
As long as fonts cost *any* money there is an incentive for people to try 
to get them for free. The way fonts function within an operating system 
is very well documented. Fontformats are very clearly documented. Should 
a font be present in memory but kept separate from other fonts, it does 
not take much to build something that finds the font, and saves it on 
disk, no matter what restrictions the browser or OS have for other apps 
to use the fonts directly.
I have no doubt that tools to do these kinds of things will be available 
sooner or later, the idea of the web as a gigantic font warehouse is just 
too enticing. The absence of tools for unembedding now is not a measure 
for the incentive or experience for users to build them. It just wasn't 
interesting enough before.

Same.

pixelbased webfonts. (BTW. portable documents embedded in webpages cannot

?? same. I am acutely aware of the advantages of outlines, that is only 
one half of the equation. The other half is the risk of distributing 
these outlines. When the risks are too big, alternatives reasonable, the 
advantages of outlines alone are not enough.

Neither does giving away outline fonts necessarily make it better to read 
on paper. Screen typography is a *different* thing from paper typography, 
and they deserve individual solutions. Automatic substitution is a good 
solution for printing avarage pages. Support A publisher of a webpage 
should be able to decide the amount of printing support. Perhaps 
information specifically suitable for printing can be provided in some 
portable document format.

I'm sure you can get the screen right with real fonts, this is not the

There are problems with many of the proposals. I'm sorry I don't speak in 
academic papers or specsheets. I'm sure there are ways to accomplish 
secure embedding, but it is not yet there. I'm sorry I'm not smart enough 
to develop a secure embedding method myself, believe me I would have 
already if I could, and I wouldn't nag at y'all to get it right.

Read again, I don't say anything against or in favor of hires screens. I

Sure. But we know already so much about the way fonts are dealt with,

Well, yeah sure. But your experiments put my type at risk, rather than 
your technology. During your leisurely trials and errors, the world will 
have gained access to all fonts anyway. At that time you can say "well, 
evertone has the fonts already, why bother improving security?" Can you 
understand my interest in this matter? When you've found out how to 
improve your technology, my type will be gone. Once someone has a font, 
there is no reason to get it again.

Mine is not a *solution*, it is an alternative, as I say time and time 
again. I am a *typedesigner*, not a webtechnology encryption wizard. But 
I know enough about programming and operating systems to know what can be 
done, and where the risks are. Being dependent on my work to pay the 
rent, I pay attention to risks to my type, and embedding is a risk. I 
have explained the risks of exposing fonts to a large audience over and 
over again. To shut me up is easy: make something that works.

That is good to hear. I'm sure that at some point there will be something 
we can all agree on. But in the mean time, in the gray area between what 
is possible, and what developers think is sufficient, a lot of progress 
can be made. That involves me being as vocal as I can because this is the 
time and the place (and the only chance) to influence the technology that 
will affect the way I can do my work, and many typepeople with me.
If typedesign and typography become disused disciplines because of 
something better, I can't do much about it. Steam engines and swords came 
and went and there will, no doubt, be a time when typedesign as we know 
it is no longer needed. But to be forced to stop typedesign because there 
was *too much* demand for type and typography, that would be unacceptable.
