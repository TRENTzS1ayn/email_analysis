I'm wondering. Is there any possible way to embed a font into a web page??
Everyone has seen IE, and how an ActiveX control would install itself. I
figure it could be possible since if someone wanted a plugin to run, that
file would be embeded within the html and it would start if you had that
helper app/plugin that supported it. Thanks for any ideas, help etc. Later.
