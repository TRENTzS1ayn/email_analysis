Better make sure that the fonts you are about to embed by one method or 
another can be embedded. Emigre fonts, FontFonts (from FontShop) and many 
of the smaller libraries do not permit users with normal licenses to 
embed fonts in pdf files, or in webpages. Doing so could cause some bad 
things as the library people could claim you started distributing the 
font to many many people without permission, or payment.

The fact that technically it might be possible does not mean it is a wise 
direction for the time being.
