Any solution must be an html solution; Adobe's proprietary format (PDF) is
simply not for the web.  The files can be distributed via the web, like any
other file format, but what is the point.  Interleaf's Worldview did it first
and better, anyways.  Adobe hopes to create some sort of standard, but doesn't
even develop Acrobat for all platforms.

It's substance over style for a while, I believe.  Even font licensing issues
seem out of place in the context of the web.  Yesterday, I discovered over ten
browsers (in the w3 pages) I hadn't heard of before.  I wonder if plug-ins
exist for them...

Oh well, just my opinion!
