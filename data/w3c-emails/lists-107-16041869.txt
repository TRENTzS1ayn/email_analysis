What is the name of the product that is smaller then Acrobat? ENVOY. The New 
York Times seems to prefer ENVOY to Acrobat for the Web.

You're mistaken. Many PDFs are carelessly generated, but the format is not 
inherently bloated. Yes, I've often produced PDFs of Web pages that are 
much smaller than the original. Point me to 5 random URLs and I'll make 5 
PDFs that are smaller as a whole.
