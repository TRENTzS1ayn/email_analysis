Yes.  Actually I already sent some mail to Todd Fahrner with some
slightly more specific details.  I am not willing to share these.
I will say that the Unix beta 3 of Acrobat is the lest secure that
I have seen.  It would be difficult to use Acrobat on Unix for more
than a few days without discovering that it actually gives fonts away.

For an Adobe font, you can pick up kerning information by ftp from Adobe's
ftp server anyway...

Ha!  Actually I am thinking of starting an ftp site with all of the
Adobe fonts available that I can find in PDF files.  After all, Adobe
allows fonts to be embedded, and the reader licence doesn't say you can't
extract them, I think.

Agreed!
