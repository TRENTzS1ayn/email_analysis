Er, I hope Lee is making a little joke, whatever he has in the way of extracted 
PDF fonts still has a copyright notice attached to it.

So while one *might* (though I doubt it) be able to make a legal case for 
personally using the extracted fonts, one would certainly be in breach of 
copyright in redistributing those fonts.

In effect, just because you can do it, doesn't mean that it is any more legal 
than stealing fonts in other ways.
