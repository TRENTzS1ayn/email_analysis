I agree with everything Erik says (most of the time).

Getting a font or subset froma PDF is relatively simple for anyone who knows a 
little about Macs and a little about fonts. The process is similar on both Win 
and Unix.

I haven't had a chance to really look at Distiller 3.0 and what it does with 
fonts, at the present time I don't believe that any of the open doors have been 
closed. There is a small light at the end of the tunnel, but not having explored 
it I cannot yet comment.

As far as Acrobat is concerned, yes.

I'd also like to follow-up Erik's point about TruDoc, just as easy to get into, 
and by default illegal in many states outside the US. In fact illegal with some 
fonts within the US.
