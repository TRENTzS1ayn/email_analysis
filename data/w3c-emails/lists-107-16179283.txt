Please remain calm. Our automated list manager works very well.
Sometimes there are problems due to:

 - you being subscribed under another name/address -- this was the case
   for the first among the two recent messages.

 - you being subscribed to a mail exploder in the company you work
   for -- this, I believe, was the case for the second person. Please
   talk to your sysadm about this problem -- there is nothing we can do
