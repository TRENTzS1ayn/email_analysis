My guess is that you are subscribed to www-font@netscape.com which is a
mail exploder inside netscape. You are not on www-font@w3.org's
distribution list. Please contact your system adminstrator to be
removed from you internal list.

I'm getting slightly annoyed by people complaining in public about
this list. Please consider [1] before sending a message not relevant
to fonts.
