Hi!

I run a PRE-Power-Mac on OS 7.5.3.

It's my trusty old LC475.

I've heard there's a plug-in for Netscape that allows one to make
long-distance 'telephone calls' in real sound.

If this is true, please e-mail me the URL or FTP-site where I can
download the software...or, alterantively, somewhere where I can buy it
in the UK...

Here's hoping...

Thanks in advance...

Earl Okin.
