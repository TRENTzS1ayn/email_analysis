Just a couple of things:

Ralph's comments were excellent, I think we should all think of ways in which we 
can answer some of the questions posed.

If anyone finds any pirated fonts on usenet or web sites I'd be happy to post 
the details to NFNT as we run an informal "piracy alert" thread.

I wonder if it would be possible to create some kind of robot that would
search the web through the major engines, visit sites, and call out pages
that contained the names of commercial fonts. I know that in some cases the
fonts are renamed, but in many cases they aren't, and some kind of Font
Patrol (even if it was people who took a little time each week for manual
searching and visits to known archive sites) would be a good idea.

This is of course possible, something that Erik van Blokland calls the "Font 
Police", it is even possible for such a robot to search through archives looking 
for copyright notices and even PS strings that define single characters (or even 
an individual curve!). 

The only problem is that all this takes *money*, no one is stepping up to fund 
it.
