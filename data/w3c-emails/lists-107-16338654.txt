Maybe because OpenType is a lot more than just an embedding solution. If 
I understand it correctly, it will offer larger character sets, automatic 
glyph substitution, and enhanced multilingual support (among other 
things). Although these features may not mean much for the web, they 
might be important for other uses.

Just a thought.
