Well I acknowledge that, the difference is in the methodology, one uses the 
politics of cooperation, the other of coercion. As I said, OpenType recognises 
the problems and is at least trying to do something about them, rather than 
ignoring the problem and storing it up for another day.

Oh, really ;-)

I don't see how that can be, if existing TT software can read all the features 
of OpenType then OT would only be a set of security protocols. In fact it is 
much more than that.

Though perhaps this is the case, I would have thought though that since there 
is a new format involved there would be at least some applications that do not 
understand the format (beside that fact that OT isn't just a TT format, it also 
encompasses T1/CFF).

Gradual movement towards a goal of intellectual property control is surely 
better than trying to ignore the issue altogether. If it doesn't work now, well 
let's have another bite at it, maybe in ten years we will have made some 
progress.

Actually with or without the web there will still be a requirement for OT, 
TrueDoc doesn't fit the requirement.
