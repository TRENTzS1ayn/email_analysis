The web? As in, the World Wide Web? Your thoughts on how to lay out a
Web page which contains portions in Arabic, without using automatic
glyph substitution, would be appreciated.

Of course, OpenType is not the only technology to offer such facilities.
Apple's True Type GX springs to mind. But these facilities are needed
for any Font solution for the World Wide Web

And yes, you are correct: OpenType appears to be TrueType Open + DSig
+ Type1 glyph support.
