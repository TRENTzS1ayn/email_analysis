You're right, of course. I was only trying to address the 
security/embedding concerns brought up in the original post. 

I think something like OpenType is essential, but somebody needs to get 
behind it and push. QuickDraw GX is probably a better technology (and it 
already exists!), but nobody pushed it. And now, with Apple going to 
NeXT's Display Postscript, who knows what will really happen to it? The 
plan is to keep most of the typographical features, so someone out there 
realizes we need the enhanced capabilities for many reasons.
