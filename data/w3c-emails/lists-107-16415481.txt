All fine so far

Assuming you have licensed it for embedding and not just, say, for
printing your own paper documents.

Right.

I gather that a third party is involved which does an online signing
- you send the signature that says you get to do this, and they send the
signature for your subsetted trixie font.

Or you had purchased an additional license for your existing font to
allow you to do new things with it.

No, but you might buy multiple licenses for them.

no, it is smart enought to know how to present credentials to the 3rd party.
If it can't do that, you can't create the OpenType font.

Honesty doesn't come into it. You can either present a signed assertion
to the third party or you can't.

I wonder what it does with redirects ;-)

(Aside - the 'made for Win97' logo program includes a requirement that
the monitor has an ICC profile for use with the CMS.)

Recall that you do have to buy a converter to make your TrueDoc font

Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

;-) 'wholly new' based on % market penetration, is that?
