Send your message to www-font-request@w3.org, not to the
list itself, otherwise absolutely nothing will happen and
everyone will just get more irritated about people who
didn't remember that they ever subscribed to this list.
Also, you might note that the list is about something that
has to do with the WWW, and you could go to www.w3.org and
see if you can find instructions for removing yourself
from the list. You'll find information under the "font"
link on the top section in the right hand column on that page.

Incidentally, send the e-mail with the word "unsubscribe"
to www-font-request@w3.org, not "remove".
