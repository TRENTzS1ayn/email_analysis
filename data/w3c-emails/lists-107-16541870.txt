Dear Rahul Moray:

<    I want to implement a japanese font that can be used on the web.
>So please let me know what are the different methods for that. How should
>i go about implementing it, if possible.

If in Windows, you need a program that will produce text in the standard
Japanese coding, either JIS or Shift-JIS. Then your readers can read it
with their browsers if they have Japanese Windows or a Japanese Macintosh.
We can provide Japanese Windows to you, or a US Windows application called
TwinBridge Partner Japanese, which will help you work with Japanese.

On the Macintosh, you need the Japanese Language Kit and a
WorldScript-compatible word processor to create JIS or Shift-JIS coded
text.

Another way to do this is to create the text using the above tools and then
turn the text into a .GIF file. Then anybody in the world can view your
Japanese text as a graphic. They would not have to have Japanese Windows or
a Japanese Macintosh.

We can provide the products named above. We will mail you brochures. Thank
you for your inquiry.

Sincerely,
Gene Sorensen                   *******************************************
