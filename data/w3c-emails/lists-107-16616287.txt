Ares FontMonger
                 Although a budget program, FontMonger allows basic
                 outline editing, import and export of Type 1 and
                 TrueType (and several other scalable formats). Its
                 autohinting isn't awful either. Adobe, which now owns
                 Ares, no longer promotes FontMonger but it is still
                 avaiable from some computer stores. Runs on Windows
                 3.1 and above.

You could try asking Adobe, depending on whether you assume "no
longer promotes" is the same as "no longer supports".
