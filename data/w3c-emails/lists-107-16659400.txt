Hello all,

You may be interested in a program called ThumbsPlus.  It displays
thumbnails of virtually all graphical formats and can also quickly
generate a table with all the charaters of a font.  It can even be blown
up to full screen so you can see all of the characters in a reasonable
size.

I do not have a web site address for the software, but the "about"
section lists two e-mail addresses: cerious@vnet.net and
76352.142@compuserve.com

I can't recall the price, but it was very reasonable considering the
power and flexibility this little gem has.  I would recommend you look
into it.  Please note that I have no relation to the manufacturer except
as a satisfied customer.
