I picked up a free Windows 95 extension from the Microsoft site that
lets you double click a font file, and get all the properties of the
font including previews at several sizes.

I don't remember for sure what it was called, but I think
property.exe. I picked it up at the same time I got the font smoothing
stuff, so I guess it's somewhere around there.
