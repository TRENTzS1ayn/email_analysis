Double clicking (opening) a font on Windows 95 displays a sample of the
font. This is a standard feature of Windows. I Think Steven is thinking
of our font properties extension, which provides additional information
about TrueType fonts when you right-click on them and select
'properties'. It can be downloaded from
http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ . 

If you have Word you can run a macro (documented somewhere under
http://www.microsoft.com/kb/ - search for something like 'word macro
available fonts') which will create a document containing samples of all
your installed fonts.
