A little research on our wonderful Internet will show you all how
to remove yourselves from the list you subscribed to without having
to crowd the list traffic with unsubscribe requests.

Notice that the name of the list is www-font@w3.org...perhaps if
you examined the web site at www.w3.org it would jog your memory
of when you subscribed to the list and you could find the instructions.
Here's a hint...click on the "Fonts" button in the top right section.
