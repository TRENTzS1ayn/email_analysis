Hi!

I am new to this mailing list and like you, I am interested in the
possibility of downloadable fonts for the web.

I am wondering what the status is of downloadable font technology.  Of
course, I read the page at W3.org but, the most recent information is the
press releases from about a year ago (or a bit more).

Apparently, Netscape and M$ seem to have two conflicting proposals.  Of
the two, I suspect that M$'s will be available sooner and Netscape's will
be better designed.  (What's new?)

Does W3 have their own system which is being put together?  Are there any
sources available?  What is the current status of Web font technology?

Thanks for any info,

-Art
