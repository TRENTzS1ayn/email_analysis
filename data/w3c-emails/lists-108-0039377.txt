Current "state of the art" for Mac screen rendering is (and always has 
been) Adobe Type Manager, v4.0 (available for almost a year) adds 
anti-aliasing facilities for Type 1 (at the users discretion).

For those interested in screen rendering quality TrueDoc is not an 
option, since it destroys the integrity of the font in its production 
process. It may yet prove to have intellectual property problems in 
countries that have copyright protection for type design (ie most of the 
developed world outside of the US).
