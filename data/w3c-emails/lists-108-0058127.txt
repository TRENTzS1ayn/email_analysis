This is not at all necessarily true. A number of font developers' licenses
specifically disallow certain forms of electronic document embedding. The
Microsoft/Adobe EOT technology acknowledges this, and includes a font check
which looks for properties information in the font specifying whether a
given font may be embedded. So far, type designers and font companies have
seen very little concern for security in TrueDoc; indeed, we've seen very
little regard for our concerns at all!

As for 'best possible output quality', I've looked at both TrueDoc (or
FuzzyDoc as it is already known in the type community) and WEFT and am
infinitely more impressed by the output quality of the latter.

This is the most egregious nonsense I've yet heard from those trying to flog
TrueDoc. TrueDoc output is unfaithful because it's so advanced? Give me a
break. How come fonts embedded with WEFT look the way they're supposed to?
Last I checked, Microsoft inhabited the same pixelated world as Bitstream.
