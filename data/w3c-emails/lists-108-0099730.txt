This is one possibility, but it's confusing. I guess we should go
one step further. What about adding some attributes to OBJECT, so
that we can say:

<OBJECT PI-FONT="Bundesbahn" GLYPH-IDENTIFIER="47">Alt Gif goes here</OBJECT>

For a font with only one glyph, GLYPH-IDENTIFIER could be left out.
Probably we would also need a size attribute, but I guess the right
way to provide it, as well as other presentation attributes, would
be via style.

Chris, should I submit this proposal to the HTML WG?
