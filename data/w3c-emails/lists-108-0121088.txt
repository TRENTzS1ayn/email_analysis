So printing a flat "one use" piece of paper is the same thing as 
distributing a digital file with "fonts" (which are held in the cache 
folder)?

If that's the case why do we need TrueDoc at all, we may as well 
distribute the originals?

Either you accept that PFRs are fonts or they're non-reusable resources, 
they can't be both.

This is nonsense, when you buy a font you have a licence to use it, that 
usage specifaclly allows print, and specifically disallows "reverse 
engineering", a PFR is a "reversed engineered" font.

Also type design is protected in many countries outside the USA, TrueDoc 
PFRs are by necessity derivative of protected designs. Type designers 
have granted permission to the original font manufacturers to use that 
design, they never granted Bitstream the same rights.

This is rubbish, the PFRs are stored in the Navigator cache folder.

Tests I have done indicate that this security is "permeable".

But the point is that you're selling the technology into a "pixelated 
world", where font integrity is paramount, TrueDoc's conversion process 
destroys that integrity. The only reason TrueDoc uses anti-aliasing is to 
try and mitigate the damage done to the font in this process, monotone 
glyphs would be extremely ugly.

I would dispute that in a "in a non-pixelated world there would be no 
discernable difference", anyone wishing to see the resulting vectors can 
view for themselves. I have comparisons between the output and the 
original font, the difference is easily discernable.
