A point is a good starting reference in the physical world, and among
devices that respect absolute physical units. Printers worth their salt
know what a point is, but the display systems attached to 95+% of desktop
machines don't know a point from a pixel from a bit of sneeze-dew. Mac
users are generally out of luck unless they set their displays *physically*
to 72 dpi, as are most Windows folk unless their displays are 96 or 120 dpi
(hold a ruler up and count the dots...). I understand that some display
systems permit sophisticated users to map points to pixels however they
please. This will make points a good general unit as soon as 90% of users
have such a mapping as part of their personal profile, something that kicks
in when you enter a username and (network) password. Without rebooting -
perhaps even with a live point-to-pixel slider.... Let's say Windows 2002
is released in 2005, and reaches 90% penetration by 2009?

More Macs run at higher than 72 dpi than Windows machines at higher than 96
or 120 dpi. So I stand by my assessment. Physical size is one thing, but
not really the most critical in low-res: pixels per glyph is more important
for legibility and typographical character than absolute size (within
reason, of course). Exhibit A: most Windows users have no trouble reading
7-point type on screen. Mac users? It's not primarily a question of big or
small, right or wrong, but of how how few points you can display before
your counters clog up.

irony intended.

My suspicion comes from the HexMac PFR authoring tool for BBEdit, where
these values are solicited in the UI.

The issue is whether the rendering engine or video system will be able to
compensate for the "real" background of the characters. If the
anti-aliasing is "hard-coded" to a single state or value, halos will appear
when the background varies in time or tonal geometry. The only way out I
know involves an alpha channel.

As for visual quality, I will expose my lack of discernment to the
typographical community by saying I don't think the anti-aliasing looks so
bad. Print fidelity may well be a different matter. I suspect that those
who hate TrueDoc on intellectual property grounds are experiencing a
certain synaesthetic distortion in their judgment of its visual quality. I
fear that such "thousand times better" rhetoric will discredit less
subjective objections to TrueDoc.

Ah, yes: out with the new (Unicode), in with the old (Adobe's expert set
mappings)....
