No, Windows displays type LARGER than MacOS. I just threw together a page:

   <http://www.natural-innovations.com/boo/dpi-doodoo.html>

A Windows 9pt font takes the same number of pixels as a Mac 12pt font.
This is because Windows *thinks* it is at 96dpi, while MacOS *mandates*
that it is at 72dpi. (ppi, whatever)

Even on the same platform, I think there is a lack in CSS. For example,
the following monospace MacOS fonts have the same character widths:

  Monaco 9/10, Courier 10, Courier New 10    (all 6px-wide chars)

  Monaco 11/12, Courier 12, Courier New 11   (all 7px-wide chars)

Is there a way to specify the above font-plus-size fallbacks, to preserve
metrics?

QuickDraw *ALWAYS* assumes 72dpi, and images fonts accordingly. Your video
configuration is irrelevant, as the OS has no idea how you manually adjusted
the analog amplification controls on your monitor.

But how do you tell the OS what your video display LOOKS like? As far as
I know, there are no CRTs with any ability to sense their *true* geometry;
they only know if you increased or decreased something, and thus cannot
report the true/actual/visible/physically-measurable dpi back to the OS.
