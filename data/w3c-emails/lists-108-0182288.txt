   Personal magnification and personal point-pixel mappings amount to
   precisely the same thing, unless I'm missing something.

I can configure my screen to 640x480, or 600x800, or 1024x768.  I
think different point-pixel mappings might be appropriate for those
different resultions.  (Come to think of it, XFree86 lets you cahnge
it on the fly, and so I bet the mm-pixel mapping it returns sometimes
gets out of sync...)

   Today I was imagining a future user setup procedure ("wizard?") that
   queries users how large they'd like to display a common coin, based on
   their language/nationality. This would let everybody reach into their
   pockets and establish a meaningful relationship between literal physical
   units like points and the vagaries of the display system, allowing even for
   factors like reading distance, which is typically greater than with print.

Actually, what normally influences the font sizes I use is how small I
can get it and still read it...the size of a coin is largely irrelavent.
In fact, having the author of a page ask for a 1cm font is simply stupid;
for me I'd probably normally use a smaller font than 1cm, but my grandmother
might need something larger than 1cm.
