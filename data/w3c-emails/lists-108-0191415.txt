Hello. I'm new to this list, but not new to the W3C.

I am experiencing a bit of difficulty with sizing a font (Arial) in my 
style-sheets. While "Verdana" works very well using the syntax 
{ font-size : 8pt } or { font-size : 12px } or { font-size : x-small } the 
same syntax does not work when the "font-family" contains any mention of 
the word "Arial". The same condition exists when using "font-family" 
containing the word "Helvetica".

I have not tested this using all the fonts on my system as this would take 
days and I don't have the time to experiment to this degree.

Is this problem inherent in Arial/Helvetica fonts, or is it specific to my 
installation?

Many thanks.
