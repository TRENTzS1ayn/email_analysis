This is not a requirement of TrueDoc, which works equally well with
relative or fixed sizes. Indeed, the data that TrueDoc uses to image the
font on the viewing system is fully scalable, so that the glyphs can be
imaged at any size. You can see this by going to a page that does not
use the POINT-SIZE attribute (for example the Eyeballs page) and using
ctrl-[ and ctrl-] with Communicator to scalle all the fonts on the page.

This is not true. TrueDoc doesn't really care what colors you use. It
captures the glyph shapes for later rendering at whatever color is
specified at the time of rendering. (This of course is necessary to
support both user style sheets and Dynamic HTML.)

Once you have 100% of that 43K, you will see "Qu" instead of "X". You
are correct about the X invoking a Qu ligature (which just happens to
have the character ID associated with X). I agree that there is room for
improvement here. Bitstream would be happy to work with you (or anyone
else) to implement improvements.

Good questions. Thanks.
