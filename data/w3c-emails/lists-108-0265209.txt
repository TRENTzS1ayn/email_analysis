Agreed.

Correct.

TrueDoc does not incorporate TrueType or Type1 rasterizers. It has a
rasterizer for it's own platform neutral data format. And you are right,
the PFRs do work like fonts, but only for viewing, and only when
referenced from a location created by someone with the original font.

Clive- I would really like to encourage you to get Communicator and take
a look at the latest TrueDoc output. We implemented a *lot* of
enhancements in version 2.4 which was released earlier this year (and is
the version used in Communicator). Any demo you saw prior to April was
the previous version (and one infamous demo was actually based on the
version before _that_.)

We are committed to providing the best possible output, amd have put
considerable effort into improving the output quality in the last 12-18
months. We will continue to enhance the product in the future, and value
suggestions for future improvements.
