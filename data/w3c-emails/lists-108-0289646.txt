Type the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line and send to 

www-font-request@w3.org

DO NOT JUST REPLY TO THIS POSTING...it will not unsubscribe you.
It will go to the whole list and will not get to the Administrator

Here is the information that was sent to all subscribers.:
***************************************************************************
*

All administrative requests should be sent to the request address:

    www-font-request@w3.org

Commands to the request address are processed automatically.
The desired command should be sent in the Subject of a mail message
to 'www-font-request@w3.org'.

******* Administrative Requests *******

The -request mail address should be used for all list administrative
requests.  It accepts the following commands (in the Subject of an
e-mail message):

    subscribe         -- Subscribe to the list.  If you want to subscribe
                         under a different address, use a Reply-To: 
address
                         header in the message.

    unsubscribe       -- Unsubscribe from the list.

    help              -- Get information about the mailing list.

    archive help      -- Get information about the list archive(s).

In the event of an address change, it would probably be wisest to first
send an unsubscribe for the old address (this can be done from the new
address), and then a new subscribe from the new address (the order is
important).

Most (un)subscription requests are processed automatically without human
intervention.  Do not send multiple (un)subscription or info requests in
one mail.  Only one will be processed per mail.
