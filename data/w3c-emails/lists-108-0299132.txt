I think the confusion lies in Bitstream's marketing of its
platform-independent scalable font system - previously known as
"4-in-1". This system, based on AGFA's UFST, rendered TrueType, Type
1, Intellifont and Speedo.

When Bitstream added the ability to render PFRs too, they confusingly
renamed the whole thing the "TrueDoc printing system". This "TrueDoc"
*does* incorporate TT & T1 rasterizers.
