Then I've been misled by the copious misinformation that abounds on the 
web.

I don't see this as a mitigating argument against the abuse of copyright 
that TrueDoc perpetrates. At the end of the day type was designed to be 
viewed, print (as screen) is just a method of getting it to the enduser. 
The rights aof the type designer have been infringed without his/her 
permission and without the safeguard of a blocking mechanism.

I'd also note that there is no way to trace the original owner of the 
font, prove from where/whose type the PFR was derived or that they had a 
valid licence to use the font in such a way.

Been there, done that, found the ways to get someone else's type from 
their servers onto my pages. Not impressed - especially by the type 
examples used.

I never saw the "infamous demo", I have hacked I font out of TrueDoc, I 
do know that TrueDoc has applications wider than "non-fonts" in 
Communicator.

If you really want to improve it you should start talking to the people 
whose work you're using to sell your proprietory system.

Fine, in which case we'll see you at ATypI to discuss the issues 
(www.atypi.org). In fact you can maybe opt to discuss it "virtually", if 
all goes to plan we'll have an online forum.
