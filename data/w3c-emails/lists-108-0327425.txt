I'm glad to be corrected on both points. Perhaps you should consider
issuing some guidelines for TrueDoc authoring licensees, encouraging CSS,
relative units, etc? I arrived at both misconceptions through the user
interface of HexMac for BBEdit. I don't know whether it's possible to
produce PFRs with this tool without providing both color (background and
foreground) and (point) size values. Yet you're telling me that both are
superfluous.
