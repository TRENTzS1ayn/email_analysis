Dear Colleagues,

Below is the Call for Papers for Raster Imaging and Digital Typography
(RIDT'98). It is a conference that takes place every two to four years
and is exclusively dedicated to typography, fonts, and raster devices.
Web-related work is of course very wellcome.

Please forward it to whomever you think could be interested.

With kind regards,Martin.

CALL FOR PAPERS

RASTER IMAGING AND DIGITAL TYPOGRAPHY (RIDT'98)

RIDT'98 is the successor of the previous conferences RIDT'89, RIDT'91,
and  RIDT'94. The aim of RIDT'98 is to bring together scientists and 
designers/artists and to create the conditions for a fruitful 
exchange of views.

While the basic problems of character reproduction on printing 
devices have been solved, many issues remain open and are the subject of 
further research. Current research focuses on font models and on the 
recovery of the coherence implicit in the design of the characters of 
a font. Can common features within a given font be extracted and 
modified in a coherent manner?  Legibility and readability, both for 
screen (especially for the Web) and printed fonts, remain important issues. 
Besides topics related to typography, RIDT'98 also welcomes contributions 
in the field of 2D imaging, i.e. colour image acquisition, display and 
reproduction issues as well as non-realistic 2D rendering of images.

The RIDT'98 Workshop will be held in connection with EP'98 
(http://www.irisa.fr/ep98), in St-Malo, from March 30th to 
April 1st 1998. Details about the RIDT'98 Call for Papers can be found at 
http://diwww.epfl.ch/w3lsp/cfpapers.html.

Papers, tutorials and workshops are solicited on subjects related to :

- Models for the analysis & synthesis of typographic characters
- Synthesizing non-Latin character alphabets and 
  managing multi-lingual fonts 
- Typography for displays and the World Wide Web
- Typography and human perception issues
- Advanced computer-aided design of fonts
- Font quality issues
- Simulation of handwriting
- Font and character recognition
- Characters for handicapped persons
- Colour image acquisition, display and reproduction issues
- Non-realistic 2D imaging & halftoning techniques 

Deadlines are October 15th for the submission of papers, 
acceptance/rejection will be notified by November 15th and the 
final electronic version of the paper is due by December 15th.  
Paper submissions should be transferred as Poscript files (*.ps) or 
frameMaker files (*.mif) by anonymous ftp : "ftp disunms.epfl.ch", 
name: "anonymous", "cd incoming/lsp", "put filename", 
put "readme.filename". Put the first author's family name in the
filename and give your full coordinates in the readme file.
Hard copy paper submissions may be mailed in 4 exemplars to 
Prof. Roger D. Hersch, LSP-EPFL, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switerland. 

Tutorial and workshop proposals  (half-day or full-day) should also 
be made by October 15th, by submitting a short description 
to both the workshop chairman (hersch@di.epfl.ch, fax +4121 693 66 80) 
and the tutorial chairman (mduerst@ifi.unizh.ch, fax +411 363 00 35).
