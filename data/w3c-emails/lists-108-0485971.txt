Of course, with agreement from the implementers of WebFonts for this
sort of "fonts as scalable images" it would be even better, because
then the code above would produce the required result rather than
just being syntactically valid and semantically suggestive ;-)

Oh, sorry. Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, a W3C member.

Yes. I sense a note in the offing, if anyone has the time to write it.
Certainly, what to do with decorative images that happen to be scalable
and happen to be in a font format rather than some other scalable
graphics format is an outstanding issue.

The least desirable thing is that people scatter Latin characters through
their document which, given the right font, appear as pictures. Somewhat
more desirable is to use Private Use characters (to indicate that the
characters have no semantic meaning in the wider context). But if fonts
are being usef purely to creatte images, labelling them as images seems
a good idea.

On the other hand, the OBJECT method does require the width and height
to be explicitly stated in pixels, which is not necessarily desirable.
