Yes, the latest public draft $Date: 1997/09/17 11:45:33 $
does say that (Incidentally, it helps when citing drafts to say
which dated version was consulted). I think that is an error.

There is a tension between trying to remove presentational attributes
and trying to make du allowance for current implementations. For
object, the UA needs to hand off somne screen real-estate to whatever
code is implementing the object (assuming it isn't the UA itself, which
it might be).

HTML allows the width and height to be given in pixels; CSS allows a wider
choice of units; curreent implementations will break, in many cases, if
width and height are not in the HTML.
