Font foundries and designers have been vocal in their fear of font embedding
on the web, and now it seems their fears were well-founded, at least in the
case of Microsoft?s new browser, Internet Explorer 4. The browser?s new
OpenType font embedding feature has a fatal security flaw that makes it easy
for any user, even those without technical knowledge, to capture embedded
fonts from a web site and install them into their system for use with all
their software. No one other than myself has yet uncovered the simple steps
to do so and I will not reveal the steps here, because I don?t want people
pirating fonts.

Microsoft knows about the problem and has stated it will do nothing to
correct it.

With over 2 million copies of IE4 distributed in the past two weeks alone,
IE4?s font embedding may not adequately address the protection of the
intellectual property rights of font designers and foundries.
