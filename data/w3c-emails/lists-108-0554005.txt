I believe, though I could be wrong, that IE4 is not OpenType savvy, all it is doing is accessing embedded TrueType (with the aid of WEFT), as many other apps can do.

I'm not saying this is a good thing, just that OpenType isn't the problem (in this case at this time).

But I'll just broadcast the fact that it's so simple and see if I can tempt a few thousand people into trying?
