Once upon a time Daniel Will-Harris shaped the electrons to say...

TrueType not OpenType.

If the foundaries were too rock-stupid to set the embedding bit correctly in
the first place, they got just what they deserved.

"Oh no - it is over the web now."

BFD, they should have gotten it right to start with.  MS screws up, but
not this time.  Whining about IE is a cowardly, braindead move.  Suck it
up, admit the foundaries screwed the pooch, and get it right from now on.
