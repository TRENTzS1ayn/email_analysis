Well...

Seems like a reasonable option, given that MS says it won't do anything
about the problem. I assume (from that comment) that Daniel first notified
MS about this. Presumably, if they were going to fix it, he wouldn't have
posted this. Now that the whole world (so to speak) is working on cracking
this, MS may have some incentive to get off their *#$)&&% and *fix* it.

If you have a better option, I'd be interested in hearing what it was.

Cordially,
David Holzgang

I believe, though I could be wrong, that IE4 is not OpenType savvy, all it
is doing is accessing embedded TrueType (with the aid of WEFT), as many
other apps can do.

I'm not saying this is a good thing, just that OpenType isn't the problem
(in this case at this time).

But I'll just broadcast the fact that it's so simple and see if I can tempt
a few thousand people into trying?
