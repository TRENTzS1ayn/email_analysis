I did contact MS first--that's why I have their statement. I'd hoped they'd
remove WEFT until they found a solution, but instead they just brushed it
off as the OS's problem. That's not an answer, that's an excuse.

Perhaps with the OpenType Jamboree next week in Redmond there'll be some
pressure to correct this quickly. With it public, they can't continue to
ignore the problem until it's too late to correct it.
