If font foundries have set the embedding bits to view/print only
the they have the right to expect that the font is treated differently
then wen the bits are set to installable embedding! If IE treates
view/print embedded fonts which such sloppyness that they can easily
be kept and used then the foundries have all the right to whine:

They have set the bits correctly!
