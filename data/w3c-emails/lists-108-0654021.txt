There's a big difference between embedding a font in a Word or PowerPoint
document and sending it to someone else at an office, and embedding it in a
web page that the world can view and extract from.

At the time embedding bits were set (and the spec was changed several
times--once even after some vendors had already set their fonts), the
"stakes" were far different than they are now.

Your "you've made your bed now lie in it" approach is neither realistic or
fair. When a major player changes the rules, then the other players need an
opportunity to change their strategies, too.
