Is this MS's fault?  No.  IE should not be treated any differently than
anny other application.  If they are allowed to converted from PostScript
to TrueType and are not required to set the embedding bit.  AND their
license allows them to distribute the font online.  Then that's too bad -
that means the licensing agreement is too loose and the foundaries should
tighten them up to work in the real world.  Is it the applications
fault that a chain of loopholes makes it possible?  No.
