You have five refences to my name address and email that are requests to
get off your list that come up on an Infoseek search for my company
name, Paracel. Inc. I have asked Infoseek to delete these requests. but
it is your link perhaps that nees to be changed. I'd appreciate it very
much if you could fix this for me Thanks.
