I am very glad to learn this, thank you. I found the Win95 font information
widget misleading in that it reported point ranges at which these policies
applied. So if I change my logical resolution, it will report different
point ranges?

" There seem to be two camps when it comes to antialiasing. On one side there

Agreed. I have yet to see any credible scientific evidence to support the
thesis that non-anti-aliased type is more legible than anti-aliased, though
legibility may indeed be the flag that flies over that camp.

Mmmmm fluf-fy. <g> Thanks!
