Yes, thanks for pointing that out Chris.

 Nor I. They do have a plug-in font rendering architecture though, so a
third party could implement it.

I think you just answered your own question there ;-)

Presumably because they do not see themselves as embedding the font, but
as embedding the output of the font. (Again, that was for other folks
benefint, I know that Chris and Todd are aware of the argument).

Yup. Embedded fonts need to be created with regard to their license
(some foundries let you, some don't); transmitted in a form that is not
directly usable, and not installed or otherwise made available to people
to use for other documents.

Their syntactic usage of the META tag is indeed within the spec,
although their usage of tagging for font embedding is contrary to the
Web Fonts design principles which were decided by a number of companies,
Netscape and Microsoft included. Their syntactic usage of the deprecated
face attribute on font is also within the spec for Transitional HTML
4.0. Of course, that attribute was added because certain vendors had
already implemented and it was in widespread use; the presence of the
face attribute in Transitional HTML 4.0 representss a documentation of
existing practice not a recommendation for creation of new content.

You mean, apart from the existing way to specify a list of fonts in
different formats in CSS @font-face rules ? ;-)

;-) I have spoken to the Netscape folks about that, they do promise to
change it in the next version. 

It would be good to see fuller support for the correct CSS2 WebFont
syntax in new versions of all the CSS-supporting browsers, actually. I
am thinking particularly of 

a) the intelligent font matching (based on the Panose number)
b) the font-size-adjust
c) the font-stretch property for specifying condensed and expanded faces
in the same family.

That assistance would include help with the necessary licensing of the
Microtype Express technology from Agfa?

Yes, exactly (tsk, Todd, you know that already) although Navigator 4.0x
will not recognise the syntax.

right, but you can point to these two copies from your style sheet and
say which format each uses. I agree having to make two or more formats
is a pain.

Actually they will. Not the meta syntax per se, which is harmless
(although the hxburned attribute inserted by Hexmac Typograph is
non-standard) but the fact that you need to have font face tags all over
your HTML, which has several problems:

- tying the content down to a single style of presentation
- high specificity of stylistic control on a single element, messes up
inheritance in the CSS
- people omit the actual 'semantic' tags and just use font, making the
pages inaccessible, hard to search, and difficult to automatically
convert to a style sheet
- encourages using fonts to lie about content/charset encodings; HTML
and CSS take rather different approaches toward the byte/character/glyph
model.

But, it is possible to use the CSS2 syntax for clients that want eot,
pfr, or any other flavour of font; in the same style sheet, without
ambiguity. WebFonts was explicitly designed that way, because we knew
there were multiple font formats now and would likely be more in the
future.
