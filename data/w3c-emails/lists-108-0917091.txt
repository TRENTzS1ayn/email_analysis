OK, time for Bitstream to throw in it's $.02....

I'll stay away from all the anti-aliased versus delta hinted stuff
except to say that the end result depends highly on (a) the font in
question, (b) the quality of the anti-aliasing algortihm, and (c)
personal preference. And, just to keep the record straight, it is
possible to reproduce the delta-hinted bitmaps using TrueDoc, if that is
what the document author desires. Extensis BeyondPress currently
supports this ability.

It does, though the current implementation does not expose the
@font-face informaiton in the document object model (at least not as far
as I can tell), not does it support the kind of plug-in extensibility
for rendering the would allow the @font-face rule to reach it's full
potential. I believe that Netscape is going to add @font-face support in
5.0. I hope that Microsoft can provide the plug-in capability for
rendering. Then document authors can get back in the drivers seat...

As an interesting side note to all of this, as big a fan as I am of
@font-face, I think the use of LINK and FONT FACE may very well be here
to stay-- at least for a while. Many embedded developers would like to
have access to the fonts but are not enthused about having to spend the
memory to implement CSS.

True enough. However, you could put the LINKs, the OBJECT for the
ActiveX, and the reference to the stylesheet all in a JavaScript file
and accomplish the same thing. (I agree that things will be better when
it can all be done via the stylesheet, but all that was a DRAFT- not to
be implemented- until today.)

NS 4.0 does support CSS font markup. You do NOT have to use FONT FACE.
Many authoring tools do not support CSS yet, that's true. But it's
pretty easy to work around-- if you've been to truedoc.com and looked at
the source, you'll find a fair amount of stuff done with CSS. (Like all
of the test drive.)

NS 4.0 does not support the (at the time of release) DRAFT @font-face
rule. If they don't clean it up in 5.0, then we yell at 'em. ;-)

We could do it if we had the rights to the software at both ends.

As mentioned above, this is incorrect. You can use CSS1 for everything.
The only divergence is the LINK vs. the CSS2 @font-face. And you can put
this all in a single JavaScript file that you load by reference.

Nope, it's not a perfect world. (Being heavily involved in web site
production at the moment, I can attest to THAT!) But, you can get it to
work pretty well now, and with a lttle teamwork, I think it's gonna get
better.
