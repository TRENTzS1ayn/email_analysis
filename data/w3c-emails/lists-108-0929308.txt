Well, just for the sake of it...

OpenType supports PS Type 1 (or CFF if you like) as well as TrueType.

Simon made the point about the GASP table, and I share with him the 
support of "grid-fitting smoothing" over pure greyscaling (just look at 
what Photoshop does to type!). The reason being that screen aren't 
high-res enough to deal with greyscaled stems, logically if you've got a 
stem width of one pixel you can only jump up to two or three, even with 
the mitigation of these additional pixels being lighter shades the result 
still looks a mess. Pure greyscaling will only ever work at sizes above 
20ppem (or so) so when we all get 300dpi screens it'll be just dandy.

Todd said something like:

> Why for art thou not fluffy?

Because it don't work at lowres.

There's a simple and well tried reason for this, and believe it or not 
it's the reason why type is as "sophisticated" as it is today. It is much 
easier to make fluffy type than it is to hint it, but someone, long ago, 
decided that at lowres people needed something better, and lo, thus was 
born hinting.

And no, TrueDoc does not pay any attention to the existing embedding bits 
in a font, or carry the copyright notice of the original.
