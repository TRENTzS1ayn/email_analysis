That is because the tool you are using - at least, the demo version -
does not support Unicode correctly.

Hmm.. a retrogressive step given that they had correct unicode numbers.
This is not a good direction in which to proceed.

Exactly the same characters missing, or different ones, or a subset?

Do your pages use characters in the unicode compatibility zone to get
positional glyph variants, or do you have the actual unicode characters
and rely on the rendering engine to get the correct positional variants?

Have you tried using Weft on the same original font files?
