=========================

Dear Brad,

For the ultra-compressed Chinese level 1 plus level 2 GB character set fonts
(encoded as UNICODE) we achieved for the Simhei design a total PFR size of
.844 MB. The total number of characters there is 6763. In this case we have
2 separate PFRs, and a single PFR might be slightly smaller than the sum of
the two. We are using a low design resolution, and there is still need for
evaluation of user readability at various resolutions.
