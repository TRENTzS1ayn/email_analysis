Dear Hiro and Steve:

I reversed the PFR sizes of the compressed and non-compressed PFRs in this
email. To repeat, correctly now, the size of the Square Gothic Medium PFRs
is as follows:

Compressed Sqaure Gothic Medium:                2,001,330 bytes
Regular Square Gothic Medium:                       2,647,760 bytes

I have found the bug/problem on the OS9000 PPC build and have confirmed that
cps is equivalent to the PPC numbers on the Mac. This bug was on the
application/developer level, and not in the TrueDoc code.

Also, I will follow up with 68K metrics from a true 68K Macintosh. The
number I gave were on the PPC Mac running 68K code in emulation. Those
statistics are probably badly skewed lower due to the emulation mode.
