Hello Clyde,

You have mentionned Unicode, and that's indeed what you should use.
The h with the line is at U+0127, the c with a dot on top is at
U+010B (these are lower case, the upper case alternatives are
provided also). Please have a look at
    http://charts.unicode.org/Unicode.charts/normal/U0100.html

Well, very simple indeed: Use Unicode as your character repertoire,
and UTF-8 as your encoding (most compact because most of your
characters are ASCII). As for fonts, there is the Cybebit
font from Bitstream (not directly related to truedoc), and
I think some Windows variants also contain an extended set
of glyphs in their fonts, with a good coverage of extended
Latin.

Happy Maltese surfing!
