The Maltese characters Clyde Meli to which refers are included in Unicode
Latin Extended-A. Their Unicode identities are:

U+010A Latin capital letter C with dot above
U+010B Latin small letter C with dot above

U+0120 Latin capital letter G with dot above
U+0121 Latin small letter G with dot above

U+0126 Latin capital letter H with stroke
U+0127 Latin small letter H with stroke

Also included is the dotted Z, which I believe is also necessary for Maltese.

U+017B Latin capital letter Z with dot above
U+017C Latin small letter Z with dot above

I would be very interested to know if you anyone think of a reason why the
g/barred-h combination should exist as a separate character for encoding
purposes. My understanding is that this digraph affects the pronunciation of
a subsequent i or u, producing specific diphthong sounds. Is there any
reason why this digraph should not always consist of the two separate
characters? Is this digraph sorted separately in dictionaries, for example?
