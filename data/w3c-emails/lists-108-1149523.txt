It's murky because of US copyright laws, and because the US Copyright 
Office chose to make conflicting and confusing policy statements about 
the copyright status of font programs.

However, Adobe has just pursued a case through the courts, which it 
emerged from victorious. Precedent has now been set that font programs 
are now offered the same protection as any other software.

You can find the judgement in this case at:

My understanding is this decision is binding on any other US court until 
or unless it is appealed against successfully.

Typeface design is covered by design patent in the US, font programs and 
type designs are covered by copyright elsewhere.
