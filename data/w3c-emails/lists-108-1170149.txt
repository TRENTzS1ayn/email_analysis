The "type" industry doesn't protect the pencil, that's a process 
enshrined in copyright and/or patent law, if you mean they protect their 
designs.

You're free to design whatever you like, as long as you don't copy 
something that belongs to someone else. Just like any other form of 
intellectual property.

I think you're saying you just want this for basic fonts, yes? I think 
pretty much every OS that can display fonts has it's own core set, so 
what do you think you'll achieve by putting that set into another format?
