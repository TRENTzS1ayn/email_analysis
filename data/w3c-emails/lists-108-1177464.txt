If you are writing a platform with that attitude, I'm not sure whether I'm
looking forward to it.

Louder, louder!

Of course you don't *need* those. It's just that:
- it's very hard to write a good font scaler
- it's very hard to define your font format so that it is going to be
efficient (compact)
- it's very hard to make fonts for any new format (ie. writing a font
editor is hard too)
- it's not going to change anything regarding the "Freedom for Fonts"

Other than that, Java implementations of TT and T1 scalers should be
interesting.
A new java based font system should be *very* interesting since you could make
fonts do things that other fonts can't(tm).
I just hope it will be implemented by someone who can spell Helvetica.
