I have a quantity of issues 6 and 7 of Circular magazine, published by 
the Typographic Circle, the details for getting copies are listed below. 
I'm sorry for the short notice, but if they aren't reserved or ordered 
immediately they will go in the trash.

This may be considered an inappropriate post to this list, however, I'd 
rather that and someone gets to enjoy these magazines, than they just get 
trashed.

     postage anywhere in the European Union, elsewhere add =A31 (GBP) =
per 
     copy.
