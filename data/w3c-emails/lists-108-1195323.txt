I'm wondering whether anyone on this list has experience with Type 1 fonts
using glyph names which have characters other than the basic alphanumerics
in their name strings. Although characters like "." "_" and "-" are legal
according to PostScript, I suspect some applications &/or implementations
may have a narowed notion of what's allowed. For this question I'm
obviously ignoring the ".notdef" character, which may be considered a
special case.

My thanks in advance for any & all information.
