Just to clarify:

     each copy is "five pounds sterling" (GBP5.00)

     surcharge for delivery outside Europe is "one pound sterling" per 
issue (GBP1.00)

ie   delivery of both issues to USA= "twelve pounds sterling" (GBP12.00)

     delivery of both issues to Europe= "ten pounds sterling" (GBP10.00)


it seems that didn't go through some mailers too well.

Charges are to cover credit card and bank fees, postage and packing, any 
excess will go to the Typo Circle to help print the next issue.
