Demonstration of Java Object Serialization as a font file format

Available at http://sunchild.jmaca.com/fontdemo.zip

and  at http://sunchild.jmaca.com/fontdemo.tar.gz



This package is to demonstrate the use of Sun's Java Object
serialization
as a font file format. The objects are built from files parsed by
  Ken Shirriff, shirriff@eng.sun.com  PCFFont package.

It has huge advantages over previous standard file formats.

1. No endian issues.
2. No specialty parser
3. 6 lines of code  loads a font.
4. The file is ready for RMI or socket transport.
5. With a bootstrap parser e.g. PCFFont any of the current file formats
can be converted.

Most of advantages are gained from  the fact that the file contains a
object graph which is  almost parsed, you simply have to walk it.

The only problem  is it depends on a robust,
object, oriented, platform independent, ( add buzzword ) language.
Which is a terrible problem to have.
