>=46olks, please use 7-bit ASCII ("dumb quotes" et al). Thanks.

Sorry about that, I thought my mail program (actually, my news
program) would handle that automatically.  (Gee, and I have a
magic wand plug-in for just such purpose.)

Anyway, if anyone is interested, I could send them a copy of the

to happen, the environment being what it is, it was just that I
thought it would be advantageous if it did happen.
