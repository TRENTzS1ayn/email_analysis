I  have ranted  once on this issue but the important thing is not so much
free fonts
as a good set of standard fonts that are universally available.
The natural conclusion is that they mush be free.  If there is another way to
answer this that
is acceptable to the font industry it would be nice.

Plus from what I can tell there is no motivation in  the font industry to
allow such standardization.

And one last comment on "free" software and the font industry crying about
hard  it is to make good fonts.

Guess how many man hours have gone into linux and other free projects  for
the benefit
of the computer industry. Free software cost's its creators a lot of time and
effort and money.
I hope that everyone in the font industry that cries about the hard work put
into font design uses no free
software.  This would include X windows.

The  reluctance  of the font industry to contribute  because of the work
involved in font creation  is nonsense. With this attitude there would be no
gcc linux emacs X11 or  Unix as we know it today.

Having said this the font industries vigorous attempts to keep font
technology  closed smacks of simple attempts to maintain the current status
quo.
