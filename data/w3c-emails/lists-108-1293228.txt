The way to answer this that is "acceptable to the font industry" is the 
way it is already done. Individuals may decide to freely distribute their 
work, OS or hardware manufacturers may decide to licence and distribute 
faces with their products, or MS may decide it's philanthropy week and 
here are another bunch of free fonts.

That's it.

I might also address the implication of the "font industry" as some 
lumbering giant, it isn't, I'd be surpirsed if more than 500 people were 
employed in design and production of type *world wide*.

End users don't want standardisation, they want all the fonts in the 
world.

Was that free work put in by corporations, or by individuals?

As most people working in the "type industry" will be using Macs or PCs 
they certainly won't be using too many pieces of "free" software (ie 
where the source code is available), and I doubt that many of them have 
much of an idea about what X windows may be (the X-Files screen saver 
perhaps?)

It isn't just the work involved (in the technology), there's also the 
design factor, type doesn't grow on trees, someone has to design it. That 
could well be a lengthy process in itself.

Mike, get a life, the formats of every popular font format on the planet 
are freely available, how the hell does that keep font technology closed?

If you want free fonts, you go make them.

I think Todd also made some very good points on this issue.
