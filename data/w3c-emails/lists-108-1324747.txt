I couldn't have said it better myself. It took man months to hint the 
Georgia and Verdana fonts which Microsoft is giving away. We couldn't have 
afforded to do that for free. And that doesn't even count the time which 
Matthew Carter spent drawing the faces.

As for charity, I'll gladly spend a weekend or two designing a logo for my 
church, or making a special version of one of my own faces for a good 
friend. But don't ask me to work for a year without pay so that 
multi-million dollar corporations have one less technology headache to 
worry about. Fonts are the only way I make a living. As a colleague of mine 
once said, I'll give my fonts away when my grocer gives out food and the 
gas & electric company stops sending me bills.
