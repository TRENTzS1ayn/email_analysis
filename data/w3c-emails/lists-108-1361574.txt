I don't know where you got the ""standard practice"" quote from, I 
certainly never said that.

If you have a problem with a technology you are developing then that is 
really your problem, not the "font industry's".

Though I find it difficult to understand how, as has been stated at least 
a couple of times, this can be the case when the currently dominant font 
formats are publicly available.

I think then we have a different understanding of the English language 
"industry" from my point of view correlates with "large" or "powerful", 
the type design business is neither.

Perhaps you should have included the word "cottage" (industry).

>Naming a collection in no way determines it size.

Again we'll have to disagree, on the understanding of language.

     paul's t-shirt stall

     paul's t-shirt shop

     paul's t-shirt supermarket

     paul's t-shirt industries

Certainly imply an element of scale.

Really? Go to DejaNews, and browse the last couple of years of comp.fonts 
and alt.binaries.fonts.

Then go down to your local computer store and see how many useless fonts 
you can buy for $30.00, and how many high quality fonts you can buy for 
the same money, ask the manager how many he sells of each.

I don't believe Apple are giving the source code to QuickTime away, they 
give away the necessary extensions for plug-ins, licences to distribute 
and SDKs cost money.

The software may be free, but in at least two of those cases it *sells* 
something else, ie free PDF viewers sell the standard and sell PDF 
editors and creators.

Again I'll add the point that the source code may not be available for 
these free pieces of software (ie Acrobat Reader), but the standard that 
it is based on is published.

Not Apple with QuickTime, not Netscape with Navigator, Adobe with 
Acrobat!?


>The internet itself is a product of free technology.

Let's try to get this straight, the standards may be freely published (as 
they are for various type technologies), but implementation costs money. 
Or may be you can sort me out a 2Mb leased line for free?

The standards are published. Your argument is nonsensical since you 
aren't applying the known facts.

It isn't clear to me that as an obvious neophite you should be dictating 
the standards of the type business.

So you can program?

Maybe we can arrange a swap, I'll design your font, you come and sort my 
databases out?

Significatly you fail to answer this question.

And all of those things are controlled by demonic industries that will 
leach your last drop of blood in the name of royalty payments.

Wanna complain?

Oh poor little you!

Again I'll have to address your "font industry" line here, since you seem 
to further imply that because of your lack of resources (due at least in 
part to the size of your organisation and it's geographical location), 
you could not hope to complete this task, even if you did have the 
necessary skills. I have to deduce from that you believe that the "type 
industry" does have the necessary capacity?

Think again. Most type designers work in very small companies, ie one or 
two people, how would they have any more hope of completing such a task 
than you?

Microsoft has freely published a standardised core set of fonts, Adobe 
has done likewise with at least one font. There are many additional fonts 
that are available in core OSs.

Because it's not a technology issue, it's an aesthetic issue. Maybe you'd 
like the ISO to publish a spec for standardised patterned wallpaper, how 
many people do you think would want to decorate their houses with it?

That set already exists, your request appears to require that they be 
officially blessed, by whom exactly?

Maybe you should ask all those programmers, you have quoted as the great 
and the good, for their source code?
