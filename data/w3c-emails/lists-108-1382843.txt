Of course, such standardization is for the benefit of formats, and we have
some well-standardized font formats already. If you wanted a new font
format, you probably would have to give away fonts to establish it as a
standard.

Until someone can see a way to profit from creating and freely distributing
the standard body of fonts you want, they won't happen. I don't see a way
to make money at it, and if you don't either, you're wasting your time
