Can you correct any misinformation in what follows?

I have heard that Verdana was commissioned not by MS, but by the erstwhile
Taligent. Matthew Carter
designed _Ventana_ as the primary OS UI face for Taligent. When that
venture went south, the face was homeless, and (I believe) not quite
complete. Then Microsoft bought it (liquidation sale?) and called it
Verdana - something about the verdant chroma of the greater Seattle area.
Is this right?
