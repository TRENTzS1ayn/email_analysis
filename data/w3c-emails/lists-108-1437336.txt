" One of the features people notice first about Verdana, for instance, is that

The first thing I noticed were the huge counters, and the problems this can
cause when the face is called at a small size in a Web page, but the face
is not available on the client. I even developed a CSS2 property to address
the problem:

I was a little surprised at the lack of comment on this here. I guess I'm
fishing.

While I'm at it, Tahoma/Verdana fans with WinIE4 might like the work I'm
doing with the "Alacrity" CSS family I'm doing here:

Thanks for setting it straight. <kid>I'll see if I can get them to stop the
presses</kid>.  It may be, as you suggest, that Matthew really did
repurpose design work he had done for Taligent, and this morphed subtly
into "sold the fonts to Microsoft." It's certainly not my intention to
"malign" anybody who worked on Verdana. FWIW, my favorite rasterization is
the 11-pixel one (11 Mac points). In fact, if you just took all the glyphs
down a notch (so Mac12pt/Win9pt would render in 11 pixels) and built in a
little lead, I'd like it better.
