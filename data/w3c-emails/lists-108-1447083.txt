What about the factor of "nominal" screen resolution? A 13" monitor at a
resolution of 640x480 has about 72 pixels per inch -- this is the nominal
"dpi" (ppi?) for MacOS. For some reason, Microsoft puts PCs at 96dpi (why
I don't know -- Pythagorean law should hold true for any platform), with
the result that Arial 9 for Windows has the same number of pixels as
Arial 12 for MacOS. I've seen Arial 9 on many MS/Windows web pages, which
becomes quite illegible (~6.75pt) on the Mac. What is the solution?
