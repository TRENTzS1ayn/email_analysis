Aye. See http://www.verso.com/agitprop/points/font_wars.GIF

" What is the solution?

Per the CSS1 Recommendation [1], don't use points or other absolute units
for online typeface specification unless you know the pixel density of the
output medium and the policies of the rasterization engine. Which is to
say: almost never. Use em or pixel units and campaign your favorite browser
maker to scale the latter when the visual angle of a pixel strays
significantly from 0.0227 degrees. (1/90" at arm's length.)
