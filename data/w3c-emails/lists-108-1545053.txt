Both hardcoded values are likely to be wrong (like a stopped watch, they
will occasionally be correct).

Well I run mine at 1440x1280 on a 19inch screen (say, 15.8inch
horizontal) which gives me 91 dpi. I rarely see PCs running at much over
1280x1024 and usually on a 20inch screen at that resolution. The problem
is not the resolution the Mac runs at, the problem is that the OS still
claims it is running at 72 dpi. Similarly, I can switch my PC at home
anywhere from 640x480 to 1280x1024 on the same sized 19inch monitor, but
WindowsNT resolutely believes that I am running at 96dpi in all cases.

So basically, neither OS gives reliable data on screen resolution.

Sure. And that is why folks run 1600x1200 on 17 inch Radius Pressview
monitors to give 117 dpi - they can see most of a magazine-quality photo
at close to print resolution. You can't read type on such a setup,
though - instead of being high quality, high resolution type, its just
tiny.

That is good to hear - others had reported that, contrary to the
recommendations in the CSS1 standard, type was being speced in points
and thus looked too small on Macs (as, conversely, mac designers spec
type in points that is too big on Windows). The problem is twofold -
firstly that points (physical measurements in 1/72inch) are not being
correctly converted to pixel sizes, secondly that the legibility of type
depends greatly on the hinting, the rasterisation method and the amount
and quality of greyscale antialiasing applied. As of course you know;
but the problem is again that these factors cannot be determined
readilly by the stylesheet designer.

Sorry, but that isn't the issue. It's not a case of waiting for the Mac
to catch up. It's a case of waiting until *both* OSes report back
accurate values for the actual screen resolution. Then we will be part
of the way towards a solution.

bsolutely.

And similarly, designers putting their site together on a Mac (or any
other system). The tyranny of WYSIWYG, again, except this time it's
"what I see is what you should see, so your platform is broken because
it's different from mine" which is easier I suppose than "my design
makes unwarranted platform-specific assumptions".

A design which breaks if the user increases or decreases resolution a
bit - let alone a lot, for the visually impaired - is by definition not
carefully planned. It might have been carefully planned if the target
output medium was a static paper printout; in a multiresolution,
multiplatform Web world, it's a broken design.
