Correction: Mac designers get paid handsomely to rasterize most everything
into GIFs before it ever gets to the server, viz:

http://www.studioarchetype.com/ ;
http://www.commarts.com/ ;
http://www.atomicvision.com/ ;
http://www.3pdesign.com/ ;
http://www.52mm.com/ ;
http://www.6168.org/ ;
http://www.adjacency.com/ ;
http://www.ironlight.com/;
http://www.artandscience.com/;
http://www.redsky.com/ ;
http://www.ikonic.com/ ;
http://www.dsw.com/ ;
http://www.eriver.com/ ;
http://www.t3media.com/ ;
http://www.planet.com/ ;
http://www.vivid.com/

Even http://www.microsoft.com/ is absolutely chock-a-block with GIF text,
pixel-speced tables, pixel-speced frames, pixel-spacer GIFs, pixel-speced
new windows, pixel-speced everything - EXCEPT TEXT. This is speced in
another unit system - one with an ambiguous relation to the first. And this
in the name of "preserving design integrity." Or something.
