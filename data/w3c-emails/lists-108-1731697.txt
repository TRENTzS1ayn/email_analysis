I didn't even know that I was on this list!

The simple answer is to use style sheets and important! to specify the
fonts.

For more detailed and specific answers you may have better luck posting this
message to a list of web designers such as HWG-techniques. Go to www.hwg.org
to find out how to get on this list.

Subject: Small versus Large Fonts


> Hello,
>    I do not know if anyone is on this list but if there is anyone, I have
a major problem.  This is one maybe some of you have come across, but one I
can't seem to find the correct answer for anywhere on the net.  I'm trying
to design a template to be used on an intranet site.  I use some text and a
couple of dropboxes in my table.  I make the dropboxes a smaller font size,
as well as the text.  Basically with the font sizes I have now, everything
looks fine and dandy on my computer.  I and a majority of the people use
small fonts.  My supervisor and a couple of others use Large Fonts...  I've
tried relative sizing and stuff, to try and get things to line up correctly
on both our screens.  Nothing seems to be able to make everything align and
look correct.  I shouldn't say nothing, I just haven't found the right
answer.  Does anyone know the solution?  Also, is there anyone that you
detect if a user is using small or large fonts, through javascript or a
scipting language?
