:I didn't even know that I was on this list!

:The simple answer is to use style sheets and important! to specify the
:fonts.

:For more detailed and specific answers you may have better luck posting

:> Hello,
:>    I do not know if anyone is on this list but if there is anyone, I have
:a major problem.  This is one maybe some of you have come across, but one I
:can't seem to find the correct answer for anywhere on the net.  I'm trying
:to design a template to be used on an intranet site.  I use some text and a
:couple of dropboxes in my table.  I make the dropboxes a smaller font size,
:as well as the text.  Basically with the font sizes I have now, everything
:looks fine and dandy on my computer.  I and a majority of the people use
:small fonts.  My supervisor and a couple of others use Large Fonts...  I've
:tried relative sizing and stuff, to try and get things to line up correctly
:on both our screens.  Nothing seems to be able to make everything align and
:look correct.  I shouldn't say nothing, I just haven't found the right
:answer.  Does anyone know the solution?  Also, is there anyone that you
:detect if a user is using small or large fonts, through javascript or a
:scipting language?
