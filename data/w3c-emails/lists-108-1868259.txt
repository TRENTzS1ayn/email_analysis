Neither is correct.
The baseline is a function of the script. Han and Math center character
center the baseline and the em square would be correct. Latin fonts use an
assymmetric baseline. Since some fonts support multiple scripts, the safest
thing would be to provide a font property with a value for each script. This
is why there's a BASE table in Truetype Open, although default values can be
calculated for older formats based on the script.
Note that characters actually are aligned optically to the baseline. See
http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/default.htm
for a nice discussion of some of the complexities.
If you had to choose one, it would be better to use Em Square rather than
Bounding box. Bounding box means that two fonts of the same typeface  with
different character sets might  align differently because one had Uppercase
accents.
