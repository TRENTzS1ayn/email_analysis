I realize that the baseline depends on the script, but I was hoping to
avoid discussion of the various scripts until later, since they add
quite a bit of complexity. The discussion over on www-style is
complicated enough, without even going into international issues. I was
hoping to take one step at a time. Thanks for the reply/reminder,
though!

Sorry, I should have elaborated on the "inline box" thing. In CSS, each
line is in its own line box, and each line box can contain multiple
inline boxes, which correspond to inline elements (like <b>, <i>,
<font>, <tt>, etc). The text is supposed to be centered inside its own
inline box, but the inline boxes in a line box are aligned according to
the vertical-align property, whose default value is "baseline".

So the 2 fonts in your example would still have their baselines aligned.
Note that aligning the inline boxes vertically can and does cause the
line box to grow taller.
