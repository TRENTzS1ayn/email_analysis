The otmLineGap field contains an optional default leading, which is usually
around 20% of the em.
If the text is set tight, baseline to baseline is the em. Of course you can
add any additonial amount of leading to that, with the otmLineGap being a
scaled value usually equal to around 20%. The font designer could change
that otmLineGap value if the font needs more or less space.

Shouldn't it include extra leading ?
I can't check right now because I'm home offline but is the extra leading
considered part of the
the baseline to baseline? Is baseline to baseline considered an em square in
your fonts?<www-font@w3.org>


Finally  the sort of discussion I'd hoped for from this list. :-)
