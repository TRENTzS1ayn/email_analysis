W3C Mailing List Administrativia 

All mailing list administrativia MUST be sent to a *-request address, never
to the list itself. For www-html@w3.org, for example, send
mailing list requests to www-html-request@w3.org. Mail sent to the
*-request address can have one of the following words in the
Subject header: 

subscribe 
     Subscribe to the list. Note, that you won't get an acknowledgement if
you are already subscribed - call it a bug or a feature -
     this is how our listserver works! If you want to subscribe under a
different address, use a Reply-To header in the message. 
unsubscribe 
     Unsubscribe from the list. This can be done from an address different
from the one you subscribed from. 
help 
     Get information about the mailing list. 
archive help 
     Get information about the list archive(s). All our mailing lists are
archived and most archives are accessible from the Web 

Most (un)subscription requests are processed automatically without human
intervention. Do not send multiple (un)subscription or info
requests in one mail. Only one will be processed per mail. 

The *-request server usually does quite a good job in discriminating
between (un)subscribe requests and messages intended for the
maintainer. If you for some reason would like to make sure a human reads
your message, make it look like a reply (i.e. the first word in
the "Subject:" field should be "Re:", without the quotes of course); the
*-request server does not react to replies. 

Changing Address 

In the event of an address change, first send an unsubscribe for the old
address (this can be done from the new address), and then a new
subscribe from the new address (the order is important). 

Digest 

Two lists, www-talk@w3.org and www-html@w3.org, are also available in
digest form, which allows you to receive all messages of the
day combined into one message. You can subscribe to these by sending mail
to www-talk-d-request@w3.org or
www-html-d-request@w3.org.
