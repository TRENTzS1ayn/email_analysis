Chris, please correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought CSS2 says that the
inline boxes within a line box are aligned according to the
vertical-align property, which defaults to "baseline". I.e. the text
across the line box would still be aligned to the baseline by default.

My question was about how to center text within its inline box. That is
quite different from the question of how to align inline boxes within
their line box.

What am I missing?

Erik
