Yes - the typographic ascent and descent values stored in the OS/2 table.
As noted before, Adobe sets these to sum to the em height, but they may
only approximate the em height in some other fonts. BTW, similar values can
be found in the FOND resource of Macintosh fonts, which may not have an
OS/2 table.

That sounds quite plausible. But I haven't seen a pattern of difference in
cap height and accent placement between fonts from, say, the American and
German branches of Linotype.

While leading is usually helpful whether or not accents are present, it
certainly does eliminate the chances for descender/accent collisons which
are possible in "solid" accented text. This doesn't mean the extra leading
is always required; it just means it makes things safe. With attention,
*short* pieces of text can often work well with "negative leading" - i.e.
less than baseline-to-baseline linespacing. This is quite common in display
advertising and labelling.
