Well, actually under section 15.3.5 it says the following (hmmm... yes, it
also says that it's just _likely_ to be used ;-)

An initial list of format strings defined by this specification and
representing formats likely to be used by implementations on various
platforms is:

      String  Font Format  Examples of common extensions
      "truedoc-pfr"  TrueDocT Portable Font Resource  .pfr
      "embedded-opentype"  Embedded OpenType  .eot
      "type-1"  PostScriptT Type 1  .pfb, .pfa
      "truetype"  TrueType  .ttf
      "opentype"  OpenType, including TrueType Open  .ttf
      "truetype-gx"  TrueType with GX extensions
      "speedo"  Speedo
      "intellifont"  Intellifont
