Those (in the absence of MIME types for fonts - we didn't have five years
to devote to fighting for *those* ) are format strings - ways to indicate
what font type is available at a given URL. 

It doesn't mean that a conforming implementation must implement the listed
eight formats. Instead, it provides a way for stylesheet authors to
indicate what fornt formats they are making available for download. It
avoids having to download a font only to find that its a format that can't
be used.

Likely to be used on various platforms, as it says. Remember that printers
etc are also targets for stylesheets.
