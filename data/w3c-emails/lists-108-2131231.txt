However, in a message previously sent to this mailing list, David Lemon
said that a future version of the OpenType spec may specify that
typoAscender and typoDescender must sum to the em square height:

David, does this basically mean that OpenType would mandate that the em
square be from the top of the "nominal" ascender to the bottom of the
nominal descender?

It would be nice if the next version of the OpenType spec would mandate
that cap-height and x-height be accurate. Then the font vendors might be
motivated to start updating their fonts, so that apps would eventually
be freed of the need to calculate the median ascent of the appropriate
glyphs.
