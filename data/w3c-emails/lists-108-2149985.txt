It is the type designer who decides on how large the font
is in the EM square. There are no rules. In TrueType
(and OpenType) you can get some measurements such
as the Typographic ascend and descend as explained by Greg.
These values are in the OS/2 table of the font.
In Monotype fonts these are set to top f and bottom g
for the font family. Whether fonts of other foundries
contain reliable values I am not sure. Many foundries didn't
bother much about these things until recently.
