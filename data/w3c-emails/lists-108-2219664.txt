Because previously, type was set by a designer, by eye, and what they saw
then got written to film and used to make plates and what was printed was
what the designer saw (modulo factors such as dot gain and ink fill-ins on
traps and paper stretch and so on, which a good designer would work around
anyway).

Nowadays, type is frequently set by computer, and computers have no common
sense or design ability whatsoever but must mechanically follow rules. And
type is frequently specified on one computer but expected to work on
heterogenous platforms with different settings for pixel density, font
rasterisation algorithm, availability of anti-aliasing, different gamma,
different fonts (or different revisions of those fonts) and thus, the
optional extra information - which basically didn't do anything very
practical before apart from being there for completeness - is being
depended upon, has an effect,and therefore thre is precedent and reason to
put it in.

Exactly. The Web is a heterogenous distributed computing environment, and
that environment places different demands on type to the demands of a more
traditional, paper-oriented, homgeneous output environment. Thus, type has
adapted, as it always adapts, to the ways in which it is being used.
