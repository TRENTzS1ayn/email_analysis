Erik:

The reason for this inconsistency is historical. Font design
traditionally allows the font designer to specify these things based
on their own eye.

It's hard to imagine that foundries and individual designers will go
back and change the tens of thousands of font designs they have to
fit some standard.

What's more, I personally have yet to see any kind of font
substitution system that really worked well enough. Panose, by Ben
Bauermeister (see
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0442211872/o/qid=948938748/sr=8
-1/104-0822201-5846809 ) is the best system so far, and it has it's
limitations in that fonts themselves must have the Panose numbers
embedded in them, and I think only Microsoft and Bitstream have done
this.

Far better than encouraging substitutions would be to further promote
the Dynamic Fonts feature already in Netscape and secure, open font
embedding. Dynamic Fonts is an excellent and secure system that's
unfortunately rarely used, even though tools to create these fonts
are readily available.

I've written about Dynamic fonts www.webfonts.com (from O'Reilly)
both at http://webreview.com/pub/98/04/03/feature/index.html and
http://webreview.com/pub/97/11/07/feature/part1.html

If web developers were encouraged to use embedded fonts, then font
substitution would be unnecessary. Since both IE and Netscape now
support this format (IE through Active X controls), this would
probably be a more realistic way to "standardize" than trying to
change all the fonts that have already been developed.
