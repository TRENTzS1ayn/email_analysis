I agree. But perhaps we could get the CSS implementations to apply some
sort of adjustment, as I mentioned earlier (font size: proposed plan).

I'm concerned not only about the substitution case, but also about the
non-substitution case. For example:

  P { font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px; }

Suppose we have the Arial font. I.e. NO substitution. What, exactly,
does "font-size: 18px" mean? Ascender + descender? TrueType's em? Or
what?

Yes, but that is not in the spirit of CSS. CSS allows the user to
override the author's choice of font. We need to carefully define what
happens to the size of that user's font.
