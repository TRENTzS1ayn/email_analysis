That's the first stage of the proposed plan. The next stage is to see if
anybody actually wants to use any of those European fonts that Kent
mentioned. He claims that those fonts cram the accents into the em too,
whereas American fonts often have the accents outside (above) the em.

Perhaps my problem is that I believed him. Do you not believe that there
exist European fonts with accents *inside* the em?

If some fonts have the accents inside the em, and some fonts have them
outside, then basing font-size solely on TrueType's em will give you
divergent results, depending on the font.

Or when the user has selected one of those European fonts with accents
inside the em.

I agree that the results aren't useless. I was hoping to improve the
results by making the font-size part of it match up with reality (the
true height of the ascenders and the true depth of the descenders, as
opposed to the em, which Kent claims can be different for some fonts).

What are h&j rules?

Exactly.

Now, if looking at bounding boxes is a good solution for ex, then why
isn't looking at bounding boxes a good solution for em and font-size?
(Other than the fact that TrueType's square is also called "em".)

That is approaching it from the legibility angle. But ex and em are
really for scripts that use both upper and lower case letters, and have
certain heights associated with each. In other scripts, e.g. Japanese,
we don't have 2 separate groups like upper and lower case. It's just one
big group of characters that are basically square in nature. So the
height of that square seems like a good font-size to me. And we would
simply not apply font-size-adjust to such scripts. The answer may be
different for other scripts.
