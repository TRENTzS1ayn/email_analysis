I have no cause for doubt.

Such fonts simply won't play well amid the bread-and-butter faces 
specified on the Web today. In proportion to the seriousness of the 
problems they cause, neither authors nor readers will favor them.

I'm not convinced that the indeterminacy of the relation between em 
and glyph features is a problem in need of solving. Natural selection 
will take care of it. More and more suitable fonts will be designed 
(or re-executed for the medium), displacing those whose vagaries 
require a master hand or eye to negotiate. (I restrict these remarks 
to markup+CSS for the screen media type on the WWW.)

Admittedly, I'm largely ignorant of the I18N dimension, but the 
problem still might not be as vast as it may at first seem. Of the 
many, many thousands of typeface designs that have been realized in 
formats suitable for desktop screen display, I'm guessing that there 
are fewer than 50 (latin) ones that are complete, quirk-free, and 
well-hinted enough down to 9px to be really first-class candidates 
for WWW screen UA use. One could make a Web-enabled (extensible) 
database of their metrics, perhaps.

Yes. Nothing new here. But another reminder of the importance of UI 
for font-size changes - minimize the inevitable casualties.

hyphenation and justification. these and other line-layout issues 
bear on the number of lines a given amount of text will run to. 
unless all lines are explicitly broken, this wreaks havoc with most 
notions of "wysiwyg" layout across applications.

I think that the meaning of font size in OS's, in CSS, and in font 
formats is too stable to upset. The gain would not be worth the 
disruption IMO. otoh, if you wanted to redefine font-size-adjust's 
"aspect value" as the ratio of x-height to bounding box height ... 
that could be interesting. There's no legacy implementation or 
practice to upset.

I understand that ex is not applicable to many scripts. By "analogous 
to ex", I meant only to make the point that all character sets must 
have some minimum required ppem before some critical feature becomes 
indistinct. For u&lc latin, the first casualty is the ex - the 
counters tend to clog below 9px. I'm guessing that CJK requires more 
pixels. Which feature breaks in fewer? That feature would be 
*analogous* to ex for the purposes of implementing something like 
font-size-adjust.
