Thanks for clearing that up. I would imagine, however, that adding it
all in a stylesheet could make them large if you included many fonts
for substitution. If you only had a few faces, like
Verdana,Tahoma,Arial,Helvetica, no, that doesn't take much space.

That's true.

>2) they are concerned over the legality of transmitting these
derived fonts

I am only concerned about EOT because in its current implementation,
it's so easy to pull out usable truetype fonts, without any technical
knowledge. I could see concerns about embedding Type 1 fonts, since
they don't have embedding bits.

PFR's are supported by both Netscape and IE (at least in the current
versions).

This isn't the answer, especially for the readability of type,
because different screens have different resolutions so sending exact
pixels is not always going to look good on a variety of devices. The
same problem occurs when fonts are set in pixels or points now,
something that makes it extremely difficult for site visitors to
adjust them comfortably for readability.
