OK, well I'm just going to drop that issue for now. If Kent wants to
defend those fonts, he is of course free to do so.

I started to feel that way myself this morning.

One thing that bothers me about using the font's bounding box height is
that it is really a reflection of the most extreme glyph(s). From that
point of view, it might be better to use some sort of average or median,
or even just the em, for that matter. I don't really have a good feel
for how important it is to have an "accurate" value in both the
numerator and denominator of the aspect value.

The complicated characters with many strokes will break if you have too
few pixels. On Unix, one of the smaller Japanese fonts is 14px. I've
heard that some Japanese fonts on other platforms can be as small as
12px, if I remember correctly.

The font-size-adjust property is defined in terms of an "aspect" value,
which is a ratio between a small thing (ex) and a large thing (em). In
Japanese, there are no small and large things. They are all the same
size, and they are all square, except for minor differences in the ASCII
(Latin) and Hankaku Kana areas, but even those are of the same height as
the square characters.

At some point, it might be nice to consider adding some wording to the
font-size-adjust spec to clarify this issue.
