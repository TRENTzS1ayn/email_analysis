Folks,
IS there any place where I can look up for info on the foll:-

1. Create own fonts
2. Associate these fonts to a character set.
3. Create a locale file 
4. And finally add this as a new locale with its associated font onto any OS
such as Sun -Solaris/Unix or Windows,
   for the OS to load up.

Thanks,
