Sorry, I think that is (mostly) just a coincidence, an em is a square (ie 
it has two dimensions, not one) and is defined by the *body* size of a 
piece of movable type. It is scalable since it relates directly to the 
size of type in question, an exception to this is that in general people 
measuring by "ems" mean "pica ems" which are 12pt ems (though this 
doesn't apply in the CSS model).

This makes no sense. In your argument the line height would have no 
relationship whatsoever to the size of the type. Conceivably if one were 
setting line height for a condensed face it would have to be set in 
excess of 2.0em, on the other hand for an expanded face it could be as 
little as 0.5em. In both cases the perceived line height would be the 
same.

And how would you specify line-height when you mixed different width 
fonts on a single line, this would happen even if you were setting common 
combinations like bold and italic styles!?

The measurement of line-height or em size needs to be explicitly linked 
to a typeface's size, not its width.
