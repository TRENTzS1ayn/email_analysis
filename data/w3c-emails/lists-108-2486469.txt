Dear fontfriends,

it appears that some people are getting distressed but all this font 
talk. For the benefit of everyone, subscription specs are as follows:

* To unsubscribe send mail to www-font-request@w3.org with 
'unsubscribe' as the subject.
* To subscribe send mail to www-font-request@w3.org with 'subscribe' 
as the subject.

Hope this helps.

Monib
