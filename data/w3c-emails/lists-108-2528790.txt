There are at least two uses. At the very least, knowing the relationship
between the em height and the primary baseline offers a logical method for
positioning the baseline relative to the top of a text block. Further, as I
stated above, some fonts have non-square ems (e.g. some Japanese newspaper
text fonts are vertically compressed). It seems important to have a method
for defining their height.

Some Windows GDI-based applications make assumptions about the font
bounding box (not the em) which sometimes lead to clipping problems, but
this is simply bad app design - not a function of TrueType.
