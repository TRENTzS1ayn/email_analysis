No, I wasn't familiar with that, though I have seen those names before.

For bitmap fonts (e.g. Unix), just take the median. For outline fonts,
initially create a large rasterization, measure the appropriate glyphs,
and figure out what the appropriate scaler should be. Or look up the
metrics in the TrueType tables and figure out the factor, without
rasterizing for a large size.

(Note that I'm still just discussing. I haven't decided whether I agree
with Kent's proposal(s).)
