Whoa! Now, all of a sudden, you're talking about line-height. I never
suggested that the line-height should be a factor of the x-height. All I
said was that some people seem to believe that the x-height is
important, and that's why font-size-adjust exists. You still need to set
an appropriate line spacing to avoid collisions.
