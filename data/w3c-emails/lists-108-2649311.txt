If the requirement were for the level of precision and optical 
refinement appropriate to hand-set materials (or even better DTP), I 
would agree. But as I see it, font-size-adjust is merely a safety net 
- a very loosely woven one - to help mitigate some of the worst 
effects of font substitution, especially on screen. I think the 
exhibits in CSS-2 speak for themselves.
