Yes, that's the idea behind font-size-adjust.

My understanding is that the "perceived" size is so dependent on the
x-height, that the heading wouldn't *look* smaller than continuous text
on the same page.

Suppose the document author chose Verdana at a certain size. Now suppose
the reader doesn't have Verdana. It would still be nice if that text
could be drawn at the same perceived size as the original author's
intention (modulo user prefs if font size was specified in relative
units such as "em").
