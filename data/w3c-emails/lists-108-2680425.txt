Hear, hear!

In Digital outline fonts the EM is a square which is a large as the point
size at any size.

Type designers will position the outlines in the EM in such a way
to make the point size the smallest possible line to line
distance in which the font should be used.

Actual character heights may vary within a family in
order to look as if they are the same.

The Baseline is at y coordinate 0.
The TypoAscender of the OS/2 table gives the ascender
The TypoDescender the descender.
The TypoLinegap together with TypoAscender and TypoDescender
is used to specify the recommended line to line distance
in relation to the point size.

Windows uses a separate WinAscend and WinDescend value
as a clipping zone and default line to line distance.

For non-Latin fonts where the original definition of these
values do not make sense, they are used to set recommended
and minimum line to line distance. This can be the EM, but
often larger in order to be able to mix with latin, whithout
having to change point size all the time.
