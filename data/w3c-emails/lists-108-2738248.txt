I think trying to specify type on screen in mm would be a mistake, but...

Yes, great. What would the line-height be? For a clue on this look at the 
examples on the CSS2 page, where line-height is maintained and ascender 
and descenders clash where the x-height has been taken as the defintive 
measurement.

No, you aren't going to have 12pt Flemish script switched for 12pt 
Verdana, it's going to be 18pt Verdana substituted for 18pt Flemish 
script - so the difficulty of reading text isn't the issue, the scale of 
text to headings is.

As noted above, if you scale based on x-height you end up with 
acsender/descender clash.

Strange calculations that show what happens in extremes, or in real world 
situations!?

Please, show me a "real world" calculation that fits your model?

If you are trying to fake perceived size you need to do it properly based 
on x, cap, ascender and descender factors, plus character widths and stem 
weights. Trying to isolate one of those factors just leads to erroneous 
output, but the only one that is going to get anywhere near close is pt 
or em size.

If you scale x-height you also have to scale the other factors of 
design/perception.
