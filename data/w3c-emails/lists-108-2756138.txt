Works nicely.  I've used it.  Though obviously not for the
x-height since that functionalit is not there (yet).

The line height should be (asked to be) the same as the (nominal) ?p 
height for that font (&size), or slightly larger (as usual). Since the 
ascenders (and descenders) are unusually tall in that typeface, some 
ascender/descender overlap may still occur.  But is that not a *desired*
effect for *that font*? As it is for some other fonts as well (like 
the example in http://style.metrius.com/junk/emtolineheight.gif),
where using the ""em"" height most certainly will produce (desired)
overlaps.

Note that I'm not claiming perfection for "unusual" typefaces
(I never did).

Kind regards
