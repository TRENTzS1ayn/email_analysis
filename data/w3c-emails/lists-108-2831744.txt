(I don't dare cc www-style, since that seems to
cause multiple copies on each of those lists.)

Ideally, whatever the ""em"", the ""em"" or similar value
should NOT cause any clipping. (I know, it does in some
systems. Bad idea. Very bad idea for Vietnamese.)

Side remark: As far as I know, "stacked Danish diacritics"
(I guess you mean capital ? with acute) only occur in
dictionaries. As opposed to just any text, like stacked
diacritics in Vietnamese.
