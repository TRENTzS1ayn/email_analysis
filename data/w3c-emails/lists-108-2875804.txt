Ideally (yes, ideally, I know that this is not the case in practice
(yet)), for a desktop/laptop screen at a zoom of 100% a 7 mm
ex height SHOULD result in rasterisations such that the glyph
images have an ex height close to, guess what, 7 mm!  But that
is of course too obvious to be true yet...

And if things turn out too big, or too small, zoom is good.
Only available in Opera and MS Word as yet.  I have suggested
a default zoom for desktop/laptop screens to be about 130%,
and have that specified in CSS.

Kent is right here. Pixels are undoubtedly screen measures; mm are
undoubtedly real-world measures. The typographic point has since the mid-80s
occupied a nether land between the two, due to the Mac's equation of
1pt=1px. The sooner this ends the better. Clive's objection to mm applies
equally to points; both should be cleared up with a browser zoom setting
asap.
