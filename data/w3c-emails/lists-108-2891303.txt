In the above example, if Verdana's ex/em ratio is 0.58, then
"first-avail" is the same as "0.58", except that the style sheet author
doesn't need to figure out Verdana's ratio. The implementation figures
out the ratio by looking at the Verdana font. This makes life easier for
the style sheet author.

As Clive pointed out, the line-height should not be based on the
ex-height. So now you would need to carefully explain the line-height
issues, so that people don't think that line-height is a factor of
ex-height.

Either way, it's complex. Both font-size-adjust and ex-height are
complicated.
