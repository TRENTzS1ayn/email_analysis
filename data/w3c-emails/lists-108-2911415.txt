"first-avail" means nobody knows which ratio, or which size, one
finally gets.  Naaa.

I've never ever suggested that it would be a good idea to say
"line-height 2ex" (though possible, even now).  One should recommend
that one uses "line-height 1line" or "line-height 1.2line" or similar,
where the unit "line" is the ?p-height(!!!) of the current font.
I know, that overloads the notion of "a line" a bit, but people
seem to be able to understand expressions like "one and a half
line spacing" and "double line spacing".

Kind regards
