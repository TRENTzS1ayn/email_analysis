Although the lowercase ascenders and descenders of Latin text are generally
close to the nominal body height and depth, what we're doing in Adobe's
OpenType fonts is setting the values (not the design) to exactly specify
the body. However, because of the historical vagueness of the OS/2
keywords, I don't think this can become a requirement, and is likely to
remain only a recommendation.

I'm afraid I know less. I'm a typographer, not an engineer, and I've
absorbed only so much by hanging out with them.
