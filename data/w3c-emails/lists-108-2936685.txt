The idea is to present a UI to the user, which allows them to select
default font faces and sizes. That UI could also show what the text
would look like if they selected those faces and sizes. So the user
would definitely know what was selected. They might not know the exact
ratio, but the implementation can figure that out. The user style sheet
might then include something like:

  BODY { font-family: Verdana; font-size: 16px;
         font-size-adjust: first-avail; }

Maybe it's more appropriate to say :root than BODY.
