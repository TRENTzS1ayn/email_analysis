That's a pity. Since you started talking about Microsoft being in a
"bind" and em vs bounding boxes, it immediately reminded me of Windows's
rather peculiar negative lfHeight thing. I mean, who would normally
specify a negative number for a height?

I was sorta hoping that somebody here could explain the history of that
API. Anybody from Microsoft know the answer?

Thanks,
