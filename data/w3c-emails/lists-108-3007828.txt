Yes. But in that case, the heading would have been of a similar size to the
body text before the conversion.

Which is of course fine:

  Don't permit titles to oppress the text. In books, spaced capitals

  titles ...their problem is often that the title throws it weight

I have used titles which were deliberately set smaller than the text, and
it seemed - judging by the comments of others - to have worked; a
combination of weight, small-caps, section numbering and color (of the
graphic design rather than typographic variety) serving to clearly indicate
function.
