Seems kinds steep for something that took some poor font designer months
of his life to design and make, so you'll just steal it from somewhere,
eh?

 

Hang your head in shame, and go fork out the $22.00.

I'm somewhat new to the world of downloading fonts.  Does anyone know
where I can find a free version of Helvetica Condensed?  So far the only
place I've found it online is on fonts.com for $22.00.  Seems kinda
steep for a font I thought was pretty common.

 

Thanks,

Shannon
