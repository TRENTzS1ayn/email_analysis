Thank's for that. It took me a while to get it working but as I added
another event and that didn't work either I realised that I used the event
namespace http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-events/ not
http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events/ like I was supposed to, I don't know
where I got the former from. 

Works like a treat now.

Many thanks,

Gary
