Greetings,

I keep being told by people who haven't started using XForms that it is not
proven technology yet, because no one is using it, there is no browser
support, Microsoft aren't implementing, it doesn't slice bread straight or
make a good cup of coffee, and so on and so forth. When I talk to vendors
they tell me that they have customers live today, who think that XForms is
actually more useful than sliced bread.

Well, I have to do a short presentation at a conference next Tuesday, in
front of a business audience representing a large chunk of the UK life
insurance industry. They will be there to hear business justification for
looking at XForms. The question will come up, "Why should we adopt XForms
when no one else has?" and I expect the person asking might look a little
smug as they sit back and await the answer.

So, implementors and vendors, I will redirect the question to you in
advance. How many organisations are using your products today for mission
critical applications?

Please reply to me direct. If I get enough replies to this question
(unlikely I guess), I will do a quick sum and, good or bad, I will post the
answer. If those who reply could give some indication as to customer size,
or application size that would add interest.

If I don't post again on this subject, assume that either I was killed in a
tragic accident involving an XForms  model, a bread slicing machine and
coffee maker, or I didn't get enough replies, or I forgot.


All the best


Mark
