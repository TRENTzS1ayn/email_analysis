XSmiles has some demos of XForms being used with SVG (for example
http://www.xsmiles.org/demo/svg_demo/finland-xform.svg). However you won't
be able to see them on Adobe's SVG plugin since that doesn't have support
for the XForms namespace. You could give it a go in XSmiles though.

Hope this helps,

Gary
