I've looked thru as many of the examples from around the web as I can find and 
don't see an obvious way to do date calculations.

What I'm trying to do is populate an xsd:date field with now() plus 5 days as 
it's default value.  The field in question is a proposed "due date" for a 
work order.

I've seen that I can get a "difference" between two dates, but no 
calculations.


Thanks Much!

Bob
