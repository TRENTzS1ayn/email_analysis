You cannot refer to an instance in A model in a bind in B model. The only
feature of XForms that allows you to combine instances from different models
in any way is select/select1 and itemset.

The argument goes that if you want to combine models, you should author
model fragments and pull them together into one model using XInclude.
 
All the best
