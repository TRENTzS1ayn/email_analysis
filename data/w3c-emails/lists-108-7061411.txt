Hi,

As some of you know the company I work for, Origo Services (b-to-b, XML
standards body for UK Life Insurance) ran a one day conference on XForms
yesterday.

I just wanted to quickly mention one or two product related things were
mentioned that I thought might be of general interest.

Firstly, David Boloker, IBM's CTO of Emerging Technologies told us that IBM
has begun work on implementing XForms native in Mozilla (though he did say
that it will take a _really_ long time to do). David also mentioned that
they are also working on XForms  support in WebSphere Portal Server, Lotus
Workplace and Pervasive Computing.

Secondly, Novell demo'ed an IE plug-in that they are working on. No release
date was given, but we were told that it will be a free download when it is
ready.

All the best

Mark
