Mark,

A practical question. Do you envisage that all XForms plugins for Internet 
Explorer will be equal?

What is the benefit for the XForms community of having several viewers? I can 
see a benefit if one particular viewer is visibly substandard but if one 
assumes the existence of a complete and conforming XForms viewer for Internet 
Explorer what is the need for another?

I can see a much more evident gap in the market for XForms design tools than 
in the market for XForms viewers. A couple of competent, usable XForms design 
tools are now around but, in my view at least, have some distance to go to 
catch up with Microsoft's InfoPath and Adobe's XML/PDF Designer as XML-based forms
 design tools. I am not knocking the XForms design tools but Microsoft and 
Adobe are not beginners at the job of creating good tools. And that experience 
shows.

Thoughts?
