Hi Andrew,

Well,

I agree that Microsoft and Adobe do development tools well. However, they do
have one major drawback, and that is that they are hopeless for authoring
XForms. 

At the conference yesterday Novell (exteNd) and Focus (XFormation) demo'ed
their authoring tools, and whilst I would agree that they have ample room
for improvement, both are very usable and lay a more than acceptable
foundation for the future. There are other tools available now, like OnForm
Xpress from Black Dog, and I know of several that are being worked on.

It was also demonstrated yesterday that XForms can be authored indirectly.
An organisation in the UK (Polaris) has built a portal that uses XForms, but
all of the forms (and WSDL too incidentally) are automatically generated
from annotated schemas.

Personally I prefer a decent text editor, so I do most of my authoring in
Macs. I realise that typing code directly won't be everyone's cup to tea (or
coffee for that matter), but certainly for smaller projects, it really is no
hardship. XForms is pretty readable on the whole, after all. In fact it is
nice to use a markup that is usable without having to hide behind pretty
authoring tools all the time (alas the same cannot really be said of W3C XML
Schema).

With regards to multiple XForms processors popping up all over the place,
well I think that is important to help in the efforts to improve the XForms
spec. We will always need many processors, because there are so many
platforms that will require XForms support. I don't think it is a problem
that we have several implementations for the same platform. All of the
vendors are committed to achieving a high degree of interoperability, and
this can only be achieved if the spec is clear. We can only know if the spec
is well written, and works, if there are many implementations. If
implementations achieve the goal of interoperability, then it doesn't matter
if there are many for the same platform, if they don't, then we work on the
spec. some more, or the implementers fix bugs.

No one wants an XForms equivalent to browser wars. Many vendors are talking
to each other very openly about implementation decisions, and where
necessary these are feeding back into the development process. I think it is
fair to talk of a growing community of XForms implementers at the moment.
Obviously they are very aware that they need to compete with each other,
equally obviously, they are very aware that they must not compete over their
implementation of XForms itself.

At the moment vendors are focusing on getting XForms onto the client,
because no one will author XForms if no one can use XForms. No one will make
very much money unless XForms becomes ubiquitous. Companies like Novell and
x-port make their plug-ins free so that they can make money off the back of
related products and services.

Clearly there can, theoretically, still be rubbish implementations ;-)


All the best

Mark
