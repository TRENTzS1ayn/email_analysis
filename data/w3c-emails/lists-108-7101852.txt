Hello all,

We're putting XForms' money where it's mouth is and have entered the XUL
Grand Coding Challenge 2004:

  <http://xul.sourceforge.net/challenge.html>

Although XForms is billed as the next generation of forms, it stands up very
strongly against other supposedly more specialised UI definition languages
(XUL, XAML, and the various derivatives).

So, here's an open invitation to list members to have their say in how we
might 'meet this challenge' and show the strengths of XForms. The first two
challenges (a counter and a calculator) are pretty easy for XForms so I'm
starting a sub-competition to see who can produce the required functionality
in the least number of elements. To give you a chance to make it look nice
(and host language independent), we'll only count XForms elements - but
we'll add 10 for each line of script!

And if anyone has any interesting ideas for what should be submitted for the
third challenge - the 'free-style' - then again, we'd be interested to hear
them. There is a suggestion on the competition site of an RSS news reader
which would certainly be nice, and other suggestions we've had include
applications to manage Amazon book-buying or Google search storing.

Any more?

Regards,

Mark
