I was looking the the 1.0 spec. for information on how hint and help should be 
implemented.  What I was specifically looking to see, was if the spec 
indicates the "life" of the message(s) that are displayed when hint or help 
is included in a form.

I didn't notice anything specific.  Did I not see something specific?
