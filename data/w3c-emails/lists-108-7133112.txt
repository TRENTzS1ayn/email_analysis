David,

I am not sure what you are thinking, but if all you want to do is to get PHP
on the server to interact with XForms on the client, can I suggest looking
at :

http://www.devshed.com/c/a/XML/XForms-Basics-2/

for a simple example.

There is also some basic coverage in the PHP documentation set, specifically
at:

http://www.php.net/manual/en/tutorial.xforms.php

I hope that is of some help to you.

I don't know of any products that combine PHP and XForms in anyway.


All the best

Mark
