Hello,

  Well, XForms is clearly a XML UI language.

  1) XForms is XML.
  2) XForms includes tags for widgets (e.g. <trigger>,
<textarea>, <range> etc.)

  I understand that W3C XForms needs a hosting
language and is not a standalone markup language.

  Please, note that you can also bind alternative XML
UI languages to different toolkits (e.g. Swing,
Eclipse, Windows Forms, etc.) or even other markup
languages (e.g. SVG, XHTML, etc.).

  Just to clarify the XUL challenge is about XML UI
languages (including XForms) not about Mozilla XUL. I
use XML UI language like XML schema language as a
generic term e.g. there are many more XML schema
languages than W3C's XML schema language. The same
goes for XML UI languages. Mozilla's XML UI language
(XUL) is just one of many XML UI languages.
