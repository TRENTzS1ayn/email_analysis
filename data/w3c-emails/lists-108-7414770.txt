We have reports of an implementation in preparation. It is not yet ready.

Best wishes,

Subject: XForms 1.0 Basic Profile Candidate - ready for Prime Time?



The XForms 1.0 Basic Profile Candidate Recommendation 
(14 October 2003) [1] includes:

[[
The XForms Working Group will advance the specification to 
Proposed Recommendation when the following exit criteria 
have been met:

* Sufficient reports of implementation experience have been 
gathered to demonstrate that XForms Basic Processors based 
on the specification are implementable and have compatible 
behavior.

* An implementation report showing that there is at least one 
fully conforming XForms Basic processor.

...
]]

Have either of the criteria above been met?  If so, where can
I find the information?

Regards,

Art Barstow
