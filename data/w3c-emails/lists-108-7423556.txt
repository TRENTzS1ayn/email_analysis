Hi Douglas,

>I'm very interested in forms security.

Security is a challenging subject. People like to say 'if I follow spec XXX,
I'll be secure', but reality refuses to cooperate with such a simple point
of view. :-)

BTW, the XForms Working Group is en-route to a face-to-face meeting for the
week of March 1-5, and thus might not be too responsive over the next few
days.

>1. Why the last W3C note regarding XFDL dated September, 1998?

A NOTE is just that, a published idea with a date. It doesn't imply any
commitment to anything in particular.

>2. Does anybody know any XFDL implementation, experience, test, etc?

You should check with PureEdge, the proprietors of that particular markup
language.

>3. Why were XForms designed without supporting signatures

The W3C works through consensus, and the consensus was to get a solid
foundation done first, later adding signatures.

(Note that 'signatures' is a rather independent subject from 'security'!)

>4. And what about privacy?

Privacy is a similarly rich subject. Like security, it's not a matter of
simply supporting a particular specification or protocol.

You can achieve security and privacy through an XForms solution, but a large
part of the equation rests with the quality of the XForms implementation.
(This is another benefit of XForms/open standards over proprietary
solutions, IMHO--the freedom to choose your implementation)

Thanks,

Subject: Forms security basic



Hello everybody,

I'm very interested in forms security. I'm looking for messages in this 
mailing list regarding this topic. 

I've found some considerations in the message "RE: How secure is XForms?" 
(mail sent by John Boyer on 10 Oct 2003, available at 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-forms/2003Oct/0037.html). Also, on
16 
Oct 2003, John Boyer and John Messing made considerations about XForms 
signatures, XFDL, Microsoft InfoPath security, and so on (available at 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-forms/2003Oct/0070.html)

I started to study this topic short time ago. Some questions arise, and I 
would like to get the answers for the following:

1. Why the last W3C note regarding XFDL dated September, 1998? Isn't there a

newer note/recomendation about that? XForms is often being discussed and 
improved...

2. Does anybody know any XFDL implementation, experience, test, etc? On the 
second mail cited above, John Boyer said: "We want to position XFDL as a 
secure host language for XForms because we think it will be much harder to 
write securable XHTML". Is this already tested/implemented?

3. Why were XForms designed without supporting signatures (signing 
presentation and instance data)? Wasn't this an important issue when first 
version/draft of XForms was created?

4. And what about privacy? Can I achieve privacy on XForms and XFDL only by 
using SSL or similar? Isn't there any support to cipher forms data?

Thanks in advance.


Best Regards,

Douglas.
