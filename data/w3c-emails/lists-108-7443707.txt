We are the manufacturers of OfficeForms.  We are a British Company and
OfficeForms is an e-Forms product, which has been on the market since 1996.
It is now a poweful product, having been available for all those years and
contains a number of solutions, please see www.toplev.com if you would like
more detailed background.

We've been watching the development of XForms for several years now and the
upshot of that is that this year we are planning to build XForms support
into our product.  We've done some preliminary technical research on this
already, identified a couple of possible types of integration we may do and
believe we can have this support available very quickly, if we need to.

I am looking at the strategic opportunities in this and am particularly keen
to know if anyone in the XForms community / market would be interested in
some sort of strategic partnership with us?  My mind is open on the type of
partnership we might enter into here, but if anyone would like to discuss
this with me, please email me your phone number and web address and I'll
give you a call to discuss?

Best Regards
