WHY does there have to be server-side XForms?

The whole, IMHO, purpose of XForms on the client side is to remove the entire
issue of spending server cycles on client work.  The information posted from
the client, after the client validates ALL of the XML, *should* be completely
valid XML.

Of course, *any* smart programmer realizes that "valid" XML can be created
from anywhere.  One of the major benefits of sending XML to the server, is
its extremely easy to "validate" the content against a schema.  Any errors
will be quickly found - prior to the server ever processing any invalid
content.

Of course, this requires someone to write a schema to validate the XML
against.  And that task is nontrivial for any production system.

I would postulate that we should let client machines do what they do best -
client work.  We should let server machines do what they do best - serve.
And to communicate between the two - we should use a technology that does a
good job - XML (with schema validation.)  HOW the client gets the form that
it gets in order to generate the XML to the server should not matter - IMHO.
