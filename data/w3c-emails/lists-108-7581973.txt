The Chiba project has just released a new version of its Open Source 
XForms implementation. The new version refines the event-handling, adds 
dozens of new unit-tests, improves the XSLT processing and fixes a lot 
of user issues.

Chiba can be downloaded from the sourceforge project page under:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/chiba

The status of the implementation can be viewed under:
http://chiba.sourceforge.net/features.html
