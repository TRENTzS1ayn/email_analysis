Dear All.

Whilst I realise that this list is not the platform for this kind of
announcement, is is a forum monitored by many interested in the development
of xForms.

My company has developed a simple to use drag and draw forms designer which
outputs xForms hosted in xHTML. The designer works in conjunction with a
graphical XML Document Editor, and allows the user to create references and
binds by dropping Nodes onto impressions of xForms controls, or into a binds
dialogue box.

The tool facilitates the creation of xForms documents, controls, models, and
structures (including groups, nested repeats, switches etc.), it has already
been tested in various guises quite exentsively, and I thank the hundreds
who has already examined the product for their feedback.

We have put the final "beta" on our site for download, and I invite anyone
interested in this technology to have a look at the products and (off-list)
send me any information that will help us to prepare the release candidate
for version 1.

I would particularly welcome feedback from implementors as to any nuances
that could be added to improve forms-design for their products, and feedback
from anyone using xForms hosted in media other than xHTML.

The software can be downloaded from
