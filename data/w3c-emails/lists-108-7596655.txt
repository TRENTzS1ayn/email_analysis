Hello,

I have been reading the XForms 1.0 Recommendation trying to answer the
following question:

   What is the correct behavior when an @nodeset on a <bind/> does
   not identify any XML Information Items for the associated XML
   instance data?

Is an empty nodeset bound or should this generate an
xforms-binding-exception?

And where is this spelled out in the specification or is this just
common knowledge?

Thanks,

-bryan
