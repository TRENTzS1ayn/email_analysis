Greetings, while the nodeset on a bind element may not identify any 
elements this situation may not prevail over the lifetime of a form. 

So while it may be the case that during initial xforms-model-construct 
processing no nodes may be resolved that match a nodeset subsequent 
insertion of a node may mean that when the binding is next applied a node 
is resolved. The requirement to rebuild after insert processing is 
described in: http://www.w3.org/TR/xforms/slice9.html#action-insert

Regards, Roland

Correct behavior when @nodeset does not identify anything?







Hello,

I have been reading the XForms 1.0 Recommendation trying to answer the
following question:

   What is the correct behavior when an @nodeset on a <bind/> does
   not identify any XML Information Items for the associated XML
   instance data?

Is an empty nodeset bound or should this generate an
xforms-binding-exception?

And where is this spelled out in the specification or is this just
common knowledge?

Thanks,

-bryan
