Hi.

I'm trying to bring my hobby/ small business to the internet, but I'm not having a WHOLE lot of 
luck with getting people to visit.  I'm wondering if we could trade links.   I don't have any banners 
on my page yet, so you would stand out.  

My website is at- 

 http://www.arcadegametracker.com 

I track down and refurbish classic arcade games like Pac-Man, Q-bert, etc.  

If you like, I also have a banner at-  

 http://www.arcadegametracker.com/ads/486by80.html  

Send me an email if you put up a link- I would be happy to return the favor.  

Take care, 

Ed
