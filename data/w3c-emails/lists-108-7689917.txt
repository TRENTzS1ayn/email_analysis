Hello,

   I plan to put up an online poll at the Richmond
Post news blog asking "What is Your XForms Player of
Choice?".

   I invite you to send in your nominations. Please
note that the pollhost.com service limits the choices
to ten.

   For now I will start off with the ten XForms
players listed in Micah Dubinko's article titled "Ten
Favorite XForms Engines" online @
http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/09/10/xforms.html

  The line-up includes:

  * Chibacon Chiba
  * IBM XML Forms Package (Beta)
  * MobiForm SVGViewPlus
  * Mozquito DENG
  * Novell XForms Player (Beta)
  * Orbeon Open XML Framework
  * Oracle Mobile XForms Player (Beta)
  * Ripcord Technology nForms
  * University of Helsinki X-Smiles
  * x-port FormsPlayer

  Let me know what players you want to see included.

  - Gerald
