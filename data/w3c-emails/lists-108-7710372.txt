I've been attempting to use the now() function to populate an element with
today's date, however the instance data is loaded from an external source
and I can't seem to set it so that as the data is read in the now function
is invoked and the xsd:date is populated with the current date.

Is there something obvious I'm missing?

Thanks,

Gary
