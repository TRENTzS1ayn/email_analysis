Hello everyone,

A thread has just begun on the LegalXML list at Oasis, on whether XForms
is suitable for managing their mark-up:

 
<http://lists.oasis-open.org/archives/legalxml-econtracts/200403/msg0000
4.html>

A white paper is linked to which is quite substantial - the author has
highlighted a number of the key points of XForms -  and I would
recommend it as a thought-provoking document to anyone currently
evaluating the use of XForms for their sector.

Regards,

Mark
