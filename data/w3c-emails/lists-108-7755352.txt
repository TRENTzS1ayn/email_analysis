As step one, try running your form through the XForms Validator

http://xformsinstitute.com/validator/

It has pretty good heuristics to detect many common problems.

Subject: Debugging forms



Greetings all.

I've been having a discussion today with an associate who uses XML a lot.  
During our conversation, I rambled on about the difficulties I've been
having 
while I'm both learning XPath and XForms and writing a form.

One of the difficulties I'm having is "debugging" my various XPath 
expressions.  One of the errors I get a LOT is my instance data not being 
"valid." This error means I can't write even invlid XML to look at and
"fix."

I realize I'm quite stuck in my ways (I've been programming for over 22 
years.) and some habits (like debugging) are hard to break.  What I'm hoping

for is a little advice from the "experts" on the list as to better ways to 
debug using XForms and XPath.  (Please note that I've looked at XFormation 
and found that, while its a great tool, I can't get it to work for me....)

Thanks much for your time!
