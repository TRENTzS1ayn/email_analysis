You've hit on one of XML's dirty secrets:-)

As in your case, debugging and checking the XML examples,
specifically namespaces and XPath expressions -- were the things
that took most time while writing the XForms book -- though
probably not as much time as writing the equivalent logic in
hand-rolled javascript would have proven.

Here are some of the tools I found helpful while I wrote the
examples in the book; note that at the time I was writing the
book, the validation service was not yet availab,e.

0) Getting XML instances write -- use Emacs --- with James
Clark's excellent nxml mode.

This gets you valid xml as you type, gives colorization for
invalid constructs, keeps namespaces straight ...

1) Either use xmllint's interactive mode (xmllint is part of
   libxml from the Gnome project, or use the perl xsh (see
   sourceforge)
to work with XPath expressions interactively.
