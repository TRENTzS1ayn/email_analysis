Robert,

We have an XML "document editor" (On_XML) which helps create valid XML
documents for instance data, we have developed it in conjunction with a
graphical forms designer that incorporates xForms modelling and allows drag
and drop xPath editing, bind creation etc etc.

The beta is available from

http://www.blackdog.co.uk/pages/downloads.htm

And we are aiming to get a final beta (including context sensitive help at
last) out in time for Easter.

All comments that help us to develop a useful product are very welcome.

Regards

Rob

Subject: Debugging forms



Greetings all.

I've been having a discussion today with an associate who uses XML a lot.
During our conversation, I rambled on about the difficulties I've been
having
while I'm both learning XPath and XForms and writing a form.

One of the difficulties I'm having is "debugging" my various XPath
expressions.  One of the errors I get a LOT is my instance data not being
"valid." This error means I can't write even invlid XML to look at and
"fix."

I realize I'm quite stuck in my ways (I've been programming for over 22
years.) and some habits (like debugging) are hard to break.  What I'm hoping
for is a little advice from the "experts" on the list as to better ways to
debug using XForms and XPath.  (Please note that I've looked at XFormation
and found that, while its a great tool, I can't get it to work for me....)

Thanks much for your time!
