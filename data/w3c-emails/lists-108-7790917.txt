Hi Bob,

I'm glad to know you think XFormation is a great tool but would like to see
if I can help you with the use of the debug tools within this which can
assist you greatly in writing your XForms including debugging my XPaths.

The  'state view ' is good to show the state of the instance data and
illustrate whether the state is valid or not. In future releases of
XFormation we are looking at highlighting the invalid elements on the tree
so it is clear to see which nodes are valid and which are not.

The watch window is valuable to test your XPath expressions allowing you to
incrementally build up the expression to ensure that the structure is valid.
This will shortly include the ability to execute XPath and XForms functions.

A technique that I also use when writing XForms is to use the following
style .invalid { border:1px solid red;} which helps me identify which
elements are invalid. For the elements of the Instance which are not bound
to controls I sometimes temporarily bind them to output controls to see the
bound value and where it is valid or not. 

It is also worth mentioning we are currently looking at improving the
existing debug functionality  to include highlighting the invalid elements
on the tree in the state view so that it is clear which nodes are valid and
which are not and the ability to execute XPath and XForms functions within
the Watch Window. This functionality will be announced  on the  XFormation
website .


If you are having specific problems with XFormation please don't hesitate to
contact us and we will try our best to point you in the right direction.

Regards

Rhydian Morris
