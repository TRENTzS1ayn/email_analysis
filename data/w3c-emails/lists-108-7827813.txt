We recently passed the checkpoint date for evaluation of the status of
implementations of XForms Basic.

We are aware of at least one ongoing XForms Basic implementation, however,
none is yet completed. Therefore we have set a date of 7 June for the next
evaluation.

Best wishes,

Steven Pemberton
For the Forms Working Group
