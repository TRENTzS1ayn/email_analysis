hello,

i'm trying to rebuild an existing html form with xforms:

simplified:
i have a couple of buttons, which, when activated list a choice of links in a different frame.
if you activate a link, the referred page gets loaded inside that frame (frame where links where displayed).

so my question is, how would i best realize that case with xforms. is there, e.g. a way to set a target for the 
xforms-submission action? 

i would also welcome any advice on dealing with frames and xforms, since i'm quite new to xforms.

thanx a lot in advance for any help.

kind regards,
anja
