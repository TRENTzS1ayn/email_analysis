Have you considered the load action.  It has choices for how a link can
be loaded.  Of the optional attributes it has, one is show, which has a
value of new or replace.  New opens the link in a new window and replace
opens a link in an existing window (which is what I think you would be
looking for).  

I hope this helps.

Subject: target submission and frames with xforms

hello,

i'm trying to rebuild an existing html form with xforms:

simplified:
i have a couple of buttons, which, when activated list a choice of links
in a different frame.
if you activate a link, the referred page gets loaded inside that frame
(frame where links where displayed).

so my question is, how would i best realize that case with xforms. is
there, e.g. a way to set a target for the 
xforms-submission action? 

i would also welcome any advice on dealing with frames and xforms, since
i'm quite new to xforms.

thanx a lot in advance for any help.

kind regards,
anja
