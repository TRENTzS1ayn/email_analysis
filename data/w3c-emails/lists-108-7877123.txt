An XForms document can have presentation added to it in several ways.
XForms is an xml language which was intended to be paired with another
language.  Meaning, your XForms document could be included in a XHTML
file or SVG file or some other host language.  Since layout can be
easily added to a XHTML or SVG file with css or xsl, your layout can be
applied from the elements of the paired language.

Examples of this can be seen in the test suite the W3C has setup for
XForms.

Subject: Reg Transforming an XML form into XFORM


This is my first mail to this forum and I am very new to XFORMS.
Recently I have started converting some forms in XML to XFORMS.
My Forms contin a lot of Layout information.
My understanding is that XFORMS keeps only the Forms elements name,
atrributes and other properties but no Layout information.
My question is while converting to XFORMS, how I should keep that layout
information, so that I can later render the form properly.
Thanking you in advance.
