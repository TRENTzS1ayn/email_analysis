Hello all,

Those of you interested in XForms as a way to build complete applications
may find the features from the forthcoming formsPlayer 2.0 of interest.
Using XForms it will be possible to:

* define interaction with the Windows system tray;
* define toolbars and explorer bands for Internet Explorer;
* address local databases such as Oracle Lite, using XForms syntax;
* define custom controls using other mark-up, such as SVG.

To give a feel for some of these new features we've made a side-bar for
Internet Explorer available, which comes with an Amazon and Google search
application, to start you off. The whole thing is defined with XForms and so
could easily be changed to provide searches for other sites (dictionaries,
films, etc.) or to display information that is common throughout an intranet
or portal.

For more information and a link to the download, see the formsPlayer
bulletin:

  <http://www.formsPlayer.com/news/bulletin-2004-04-30.html>

The bulletin also contains details on how to join the fP:2.0 beta programme,
if that is of interest.

Regards,

Mark
