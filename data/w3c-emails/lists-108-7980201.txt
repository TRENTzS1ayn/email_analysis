A version of formsPlayer is available as a plug-in for IE6. fP was one of
the two processors that implemented 100% of XForms 1.0, and so allowed the
spec to become a full standard. It's available as a free download from:

  <http://www.formsPlayer.com/download/>


fP is more than an XForms processor though. For a taster of some of the
things we have in the pipeline take a look at our customisable search-bar,
allowing you to search Amazon and Google from an Internet Explorer side-bar
- all expressed with XForms:
