Victor, 

      First what does the nodeset "job", in "job-bind", refer to?  This
could be confusing the situation.  
      As I understand what you are trying to do, you would like to have
the value that is shown when you select (the label) to be on thing and
the value returned another (the value), correct?  The code you have
below will choose the "OK" or "Not OK" as the label and the value.  To
do what you want you would have to point the label ref to a different
nodeset.

I am trying to get the possible choices for a select1 statement from one

instance, and the actual values of the selects from a different 
instance. The problem is, in Chiba, the latter is ignored, and all 
select boxes show only the first alternative. The code is as follows:

<xf:instance id="jobResults">
<results xmlns="">
<result>
<label>OK</label>
<value>Ok</value>
</result>
<result>
<label>Not OK</label>
<value>Not Ok</value>
</result>
</results>
</xf:instance>

...
<xf:bind id="job-bind" nodeset="job">
<xf:bind id="jobResult-bind" nodeset="result"/>
...

<xf:select1 id="jobResult" bind="jobResult-bind">
<xf:label>Status</xf:label>
<xf:itemset nodeset="instance('jobResults')/result">
<xf:label ref="label"/>
<xf:value ref="value"/>
</xf:itemset>
</xf:select1>

Can it be that jobResult-bind doesn't resolve to the same instance 
document as job-bind, but instead looks in instance('jobResults')?
