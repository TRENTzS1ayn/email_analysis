The example is working, valid XForms. See the reply to Susan Borgrink.

That is exactly what I want.

What I do not understand here is the part of " an xf:select(1) that 
takes its selection choices from one instance and places the result in 
another". Would anyone want to fetch the choices from the input/output 
file, according to some "selected" attribute? That would be redundant in 
the extreme.

I'm sorry to say that fP already has been evaluated (albeit only a short 
time) and discarded as an option for our project since it seems unable 
to display the data in an orderly table. While Chiba looks like 
http://vengmark.home.cern.ch/vengmark/moi/screenshots/chiba.png after 
only minimal CSS editing, fP looks like 
http://vengmark.home.cern.ch/vengmark/moi/screenshots/formsplayer.png. 
If you can provide me with an example of an fP XForms document which 
looks more like the Chiba example, I would be happy to re-evaluate your 
product.
