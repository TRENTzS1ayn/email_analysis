Victor, should it interest you we have done a lot of work developing a drag
and draw forms designer for xForms, and will be putting a beta3 (release
candidate) out this weekend.

The form at
http://www.onform.biz/xformsprojects/via_formsplayer/grid/xForm_1.htm is
direct output from the designer, and it took longer to ftp it to the web
than it did to create it

Best Regards

Rob

The example is working, valid XForms. See the reply to Susan Borgrink.

That is exactly what I want.

What I do not understand here is the part of " an xf:select(1) that
takes its selection choices from one instance and places the result in
another". Would anyone want to fetch the choices from the input/output
file, according to some "selected" attribute? That would be redundant in
the extreme.

I'm sorry to say that fP already has been evaluated (albeit only a short
time) and discarded as an option for our project since it seems unable
to display the data in an orderly table. While Chiba looks like
http://vengmark.home.cern.ch/vengmark/moi/screenshots/chiba.png after
only minimal CSS editing, fP looks like
http://vengmark.home.cern.ch/vengmark/moi/screenshots/formsplayer.png.
If you can provide me with an example of an fP XForms document which
looks more like the Chiba example, I would be happy to re-evaluate your
product.
