The designer currently supports absolute positioning or positioning relative
to formbody text, but this version would not create the tables that you
require, so could not put labels as headers.

I'll take a look at it ASAP, but it would be great if you could answer
some questions beforehand:
- Does the designer support dynamic positioning of the input elements,
but still displaying them as a table? It is _not_ an option to use
absolute positioning for our project, as the layout must be as dynamic
as possible. Chiba supports this.
- Is it possible to make labels occur in the table header instead of
being displayed at each input element? Chiba supports this.

Yours sincerely,
