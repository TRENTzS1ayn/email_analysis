And you're still missing the point --- which is unfortunate.

That excellent article you refer to is not talking about UI
languages it's talking about what it takes to put together
webapps -- and apps need to be more than screen-deep. 

Another thing that was evident at the WWW 2004 conference was
the coming together of technologies such as XForms, CSS, SVG and
the DOM2/XML-Events bits to together create a best of breed
webapp solution.

Point solutions like the various UI-only languages you name
will  remain relevant for niche cases --- but could become part
of a much bigger picture by playing together with XForms just as
CSS XHTML and SVG do.

So you can continue the polemic  by asking "which is the best UI
language"; alternatively you can create web applications that
actually meet users needs.
