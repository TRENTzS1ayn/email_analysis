Pierre,

If you want to submit two instances, the easiest way is just to have two
submits, one for each. You can then use something like:

<xforms:trigger>
    <xforms:label>Send Something Simple</xforms:label>
    <xforms:action ev:event="DOMActivate">
        <xforms:send submission="submit1"/>
        <xforms:send submission="submit2"/>
    </xforms:action>
</xforms:trigger>

to use them.

I think this should be tidier than trying a union XPath.

All the best

Mark
