Hello Mark,

  Well, my point was that the W3C is supposed to bring
together browser vendors/project and lead the web to
its full potential.

  However, it looks like the W3C is increasingly
irrelevant. If the W3C can't unite the browser
vendors, who can? Why doesn't the W3C lobby harder?
Why doesn't the W3C publish, for example, the
roadmaps/positions of browser vendors such as
Microsoft, Apple, Opera, Mozilla, etc?

  As everybody can see the secret backroom dealing is
getting us nowhere and the rich internet for everyone
will be lost.

  They surely help to find out how popular something
is. And I'm sorry if you can't deal with the results
that tell you that XForms is irrelevant.

  Why not put up your own poll and see if you come to
a different conclusion.
