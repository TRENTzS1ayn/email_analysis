Pierre,

I'm not an XForms expert....  But, I think I noticed a possible typo in your 
code...

In

<xforms:bind xforms:id="bind_1" nodeset="instance('instance_0')/champ1"
  type="xs:integer" constraint="string-length()=2" required="true()"/>

You are "typing" your bing to xs:integer     But I don't see the XS name space 
declared.  Is it possible that should be xsd:integer?

I don't know if it makes a difference at the <instance> level, but my xforms 
code has types in my instance variables as well (atleast those that are *not* 
declared in a schema.)

Hope this helps!

Bob
