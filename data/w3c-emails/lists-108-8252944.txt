My interpretation was that people thought the poll was irrelevant. I don't 
think it really means much about XForms.

My experience is that the W3C has to tread extremely carefully to avoid 
offending its leading members. Lobbying its members to change their ways 
seems unthinkable. It was the Web Standards Project, not the W3C, that 
pursuaded members to comply with the standards their own consortium had 
produced.
