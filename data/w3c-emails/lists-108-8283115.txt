Well, I found out I could use the number() function to be sure the user enter an integer only, doing like this:

<xforms:bind xforms:id="bind_2" nodeset="instance('instance_0')/champ2" type="xs:integer" constraint="number()&gt;0" required="true()"/>

On the others end, I tried adding the xs name space and didn't notice any change, but it make the Xforms more coherent.

I am still looking for a way to use regular expressions if you have any idea.

Thans for your replies
Best regards

Pierre
