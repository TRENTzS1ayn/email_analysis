Hello Everyone

I am a newbie to this list so let me ask a silly question: Why the lack of
XForms support by the web browser vendors seen as a showstopper?

Let's cosider public internet. Your user has full control over her web
browser. Any information coming from "IE 6.0" may have actually been
generated by the perl script etc. If it comes form the client - it can not
be trusted. If I run my XForms engine on the client machine, the XML being
posted to the server needs to be further validated. Do I need to have yet
another XForms engine on the server?

What happaned to the idea of coexisting with established technologies? Full
server side XForms implementation where conventional HTML and JavaScript is
generated out of the XHTML template and served to the client requires no
modifications to the client's browser whatsoever. This approach also follows
the security guidelines where the only mission of the client-side validation
is to provide feedback to the user and is duplicated on the server as only
the server-side code is reliable.

I was able to find only one fully functional XForms server-side engine - the
Chiba project. If there is more - please help me find out. Maybe Microsoft
will endorse XForms when they see an industry-standard secure and robust
XForms engine for .Net platform....
