Dmitri,

There is a good selection of server-side implementations of XForms other than Chiba. For example:

Oracle (both client and server-side support): http://otn.oracle.com/tech/wireless/mobilebrowser.htm

Novell (server-side support, client-side coming soon): http://www.novell.com/products/extend/

Orbeon: http://www.orbeon.com/oxf/doc/index

FormFaces: http://www.formfaces.com/main.jsp

X-Toolbox: http://www.hico.com (German language only at the moment - I think)

This list is not exhaustive, but gives a flavour of what is available.

All the best

Mark
