I am pretty certain that it doesn't allow direct editing of XML data.
However you can write XML data in a text area which is then escaped to
character data, therefore you could also populate an instance with XML
data by escaping the data you want inserted.

It was also something that I tried to do with XForms (when designing a
form that could add any tags to a HTML "header" space) see
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-forms/2004Apr/0006.html.

I'm not sure whether it would be feasible or not to try and make it an
XForms 1.1 requirement, or whether the committee sees it as a useful
feature.

Hope this information was helpful, 

Gary
