We now have a list for RDF IG / Semantic Web discussion of XML/RDF-based
calendar and scheduling systems: mailto:www-rdf-calendar@w3.org


to subscribe to the mailing list, send a message:

To: www-rdf-calendar-request@w3.org
Subject: subscribe 
(or 'unsubscribe' if it all proves too much)

Web archives: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-calendar/

The list is public, archived, and like www-rdf-logic and the RDF IG IRC
channel (http://www.w3.org/RDF/Interest/#irc) falls under the Semantic
Web Activity within W3C (http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/).

scope:
Use www-rdf-calendar for detailed technical discussion of systems,
vocabulary and scenarios relating to the use of RDF and XML with
calendaring and scheduling tools on the Web. Please try to avoid
crossposts with the other RDF lists. The focus of the list is on
practical implementation work (testbeds, prototypes, collaborative
development), although theoretical work (eg. on representations for
events, time-periods etc) in RDF, XML, DAML etc. is in scope. 

Have fun...

Dan
