In the Web Standards Update session
http://www.gca.org/attend/1999_conferences/xml_99/xml99_keynote.htm#web
at XML '99 in Philadelphia
http://www.gca.org/attend/1999_conferences/xml_99/default.htm

a questioner asked:

Q: Have the W3C plans for a standard for web-based asynchronous
messaging
     providing such functionality as is found in a typical MOM (such as
IBM's
     MQSERIES)? 

to which my answer was that W3C had started planning a workshop
on XML in distributed applications, i.e. RPC and inter-application
messaging, but we hadn't found a critical mass of resources for
the workshop.

I mentioned that I was looking forward to

XTech 2000 27 Feb - 2 Mar 2000, San Jose, California
http://www.gca.org/attend/2000_conferences/xtech_2000/

and

WWW9, Amsterdam, May 15 - 19, 2000
http://www9.org/

as possible venues to continue the discussion.

There were sign-up sheets for lunch table discussions, and
Tim Schweitzer of Nortel Technology claimed table #17 for
"XML and Protocols" or something like that, presumably
to continue this discussion.

After a lively chat about

Transaction Internet Protocol Version 3.0

http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2372.txt

Information & Content Exchange (ICE)

XML-RPC

WDDX.org: Web Distributed Data Exchange 
http://www.wddx.org/

and the like, I agreed to create a mailing list to continue the
discussion,
and make a pointer to it from
http://www.w3.org/XML/

So... here we are. I have copied the few people whom I can remember
from the lunch discussion, plus various people who have contacted
me about this sort of stuff in the recent past.
