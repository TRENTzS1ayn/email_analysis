We've been under pressure from many sources, including the advisory
board, to address the threat of fragmentation of and investigate the
exciting opportunities in the area of XML protocols. It makes sense to
address this now because the technology is still early in its
evolution and more resources for development will be available as
XSL-FO and XML Schemas near completion.

We will be looking for input at XTech 2000. We are attempting to
organize a BOF Wednesday March 1 at 4:00pm. Unfortunately, this will
conflict with session #8 (Simplification). Once we know a place and
are more firm on the time, we will send mail to xml-dist-app and post
the info on an appropriate message board or information booth at
XTech. Look for the following W3C staff at XTech: Daniel Veillard,
Henry Thompson, Eric Prud'hommeaux, and Michael Sperberg-McQueen.

There will also be a BOF the Adelaide IETF, where Joseph Reagle and
Charles McCathieNevile will look for input from internet circles.
At WWW9 in Amsterdam we will have a public requirements debate. 
Please see the W3C track schedule for time and place.

We need to figure out where standardization is most important, and
which technologies can be developed independently. We are looking at
components like data typing, marshalling conventions,
synchronous/asynchronous messaging, social protocol attachments,
protocol definition and machine verification, etc.

Discussion on this list is quite appropriate - please send pointers
to anything which has bearing on the issue.
