We wish to hold an open meeting to discuss ecommerce data exchange
problems and techniques. In IETF47 there will be a BOF
on this area and material discussed will input this BOF.

The problem areas being addressed: 

     Particularly in the ecommerce area, there is a rapidly growing need
to
exchange data between applications. XML, as an application-neutral and
metadata-aware medium, is used to describe and express the data. For
various
application areas, there are industry consortiums and other bodies
defining
schema, but currently there is no common underlying protocol for
transmisson
of the data. 
     Existing protocols for RPC or object invocation - such as IIOP and
DCOM -
appear to have enough difficulties so that other WEB approaches need to
be
evaluated. SOAP is an example technology that will be examined.

Our meeting will discuss this problem space and related technologies.

When: Tuesday, January 25th, 2000
        Start: 10am
        End:    4pm 

Where: Netscape
